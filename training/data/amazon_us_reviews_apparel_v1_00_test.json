I have three Stetson caps, and they're all great...better than they look in the pictures. I like this water repellant cap because I don't like to carry an umbrella, and it also serves as a standard cap on a dry day, especially during the warm months. I also like the neutral khaki color."}

I think it took a little while to get it, but it does state that when you order it.

Above that, it's too heavy.  The shell is heavy as is the lining.  It also runs pretty big, which is good if you're going to wear layers in winter in the North.

{"label":2,"review":"I'm not one to dress up sexy in expensive lingerie just for it to end up on the floor a few moments later, so I decided to go on the cheaper end of the scale. I wanted something that was inexpensive yet still moderately revealing and came across this and thought to myself &#34;Perfect. Nothing too stringy or complicated&#34; (because we all know getting in and out of lingerie is a kill-joy when it takes forever to unbutton or untie or unlace.) However, this is not a lingerie set one might try to wear all day waiting for your boyfriend\/husband to come home. The g-string and bra are relatively soft lace but I find the cuffs of the shirt to be rather gripping and uncomfortable. The bra is also more like a bikini top that needs to be tied at the neck and to get any lift for the girls you gotta tie it tight which is also rather uncomfortable (mind you I'm a B cup). To sum it up I would recommend this to petite women with good tolerance."}

The opening for urination is up near my belly button, nowhere near the place it ought to be, and the pocket is too shallow, causing things to drop out all the time.

The bad: The straps are very long, I usually wear them as short as they'll go, the sides are cut low (lower than my Carhartts) resulting in visible underwear if your shirt isn't long enough.

It is the first time in my life I'm not afraid of the wind gusts to break my umbrella.  Easy to handle, absolutely had no problem opening and closing it (it did not pinch me).  The size is just right. Big and comfortable for me and at the same time not too big that you can't walk on the street. Another advantage is that it actually protects you from being poked by other people's umbrellas.    For moms: If you are caught in the rain with your baby on you, I'm sure this is one of the best umbrellas to have to protect the baby from getting wet.    It looks very nice and you see through it which is great!  Very happy with my purchase and if this one ever breaks, I will definitely buy again."}

Although it was an amazing wig, I have to take away a star because I constantly had to rebraid it (pretty much every performance and we had 10!!!) due to many flyaways. Also, I really did not like the original braids it came in since it left so much hair remaining out of the braid and it just looked tacky.

{"label":3,"review":"So, the silk is pretty nice. I got the green one cuz it was a few bucks cheaper. You don't really notice the niceness of the silk until you put it on. Then it feels really nice. But there are four problems with getting this item:<br \/><br \/>1. These things actually ride up in my backside more than my super-short boxers do. May have something to do with there being more material to ride up.<br \/>2. The tags on the back waistline are not designed to be removed. This is an issue for people with sensitive skin like me, or who want maximum comfort. I removed the tags anyway and it actually removes the waist seam and leaves a big hole. It will probably let all the waist threading come out eventually, but I feel like I won't even wear them with the tags in there so I did it anyway.<br \/>3. The double-flap front hole system is sort of unnecessary. They should just have a one-flap button system.<br \/>4. For the above three reasons, there's really no sense in getting one pair of these when I could get three better overall pair at Kohl's for the same price. Those are actually designed to have the tags removed, they ride up less than this pair does, and they have a one-flap system in front. And actually they are really soft too, albeit a different kind of soft.<br \/><br \/>Unless there's some reason you must have this exact silk material, I would not buy. Save some money.<br \/>P.S. This is a side note that I didn't factor into my review, but these things are actually too smooth. You wouldn't think that's possible, but it is. They were so smooth and frictionless that I actually started to slide out of my office chair while trying to get some work done. It was such a weird thing I started laughing when it happened. But seriously, these boxers didn't have enough friction to keep my behind stationary, whether I was wearing pants or not. I tried it both ways. Be warned. :)<br \/><br \/>SEVERAL MONTHS LATER:<br \/>The one pair I have has actually become my favorite home pair. I use them for lounging around and when I want to relax. But I would still not wear them outside of the house. They are too slippery and distracting while I'm at work, plus they ride up, and it's hard to pull out wedgies every few minutes when you're in public. But for when I'm at home watching a movie on the couch, I'm not moving around and it doesn't bother me. So I have changed my review from 3 to 4 stars because I feel that while I would not get 7 pairs of these for 7 days of the week, having 2 pair for home seems like a very practical purpose for them.for lounging around and when I want to relax. But I would still not wear them outside of the house.

So I have changed my review from 3 to 4 stars because I feel that while I would not get 7 pairs of these for 7 days of the week, having 2 pair for home seems like a very practical purpose for them."}
{"label":2,"review":"Great little jacket. I ordered the XL and it is still snug for my size 10\/12. I don't usually wear an XL in anything. I wore it buttoned up for a Halloween costume, but for everyday wear it is not comfortable across the chest and shoulders when buttoned up.  The fabric is lovely and good quality. The color is as shown. The inner lining is just beautiful."}
{"label":4,"review":"I received this when I was suppose too. It fits perfect. I love it. I would recommend this to everyone. I have it on today.<br \/>Thank you so much."}
{"label":1,"review":"I bought these because I generally buy underwear in multi-packs and was wondering if buying them from a true lingerie manufacturer would make me fall in love with these slightly higher priced panties.  Sadly, cotton Hanes Stretch Boy Briefs with Lace are way better."}
{"label":4,"review":"They fit great, comfortable to wear. Quality made. Definitely recommend."}
{"label":4,"review":"great"}
{"label":4,"review":"I looked everywhere in stores for nonpolyester robe for my wife and could not find one for Christmas.  Should have looked on line first.  This is spa quality and delivered to house within 5 days. Excellent quality for price and all I had to do was measure the length her robe she has now to be sure this one would fit."}
{"label":2,"review":"Good fit and being enjoyed"}
{"label":3,"review":"I needed this for a minion costume and it was perfect.  People loved how the color matched the costume so well.  Comfy but a lil hard to see out of and a bit sweaty in the sun.  These are expected issues but something to consider if you plan to wear this longer times."}
{"label":1,"review":"Overall the hat is nice, the knit is soft and the colors true to picture.  The only problem is the size is way too small.  We had a houseful of people in Christmas and no one could put on their head except a seven year old child.  The should not be classified as an adult men's hat but should be as a child boy's."}
{"label":4,"review":"I recently stopped breast feeding my son and needed a couple of smaller new bras that fit my no longer full boobs.  Sad day.  I went to Kohl's department store and tried on 15 or so bras and these were so soft and felt amazing.  They were buy one get one half but it was still $60.00!  That is a little to expensive for two bras!  I looked on Amazon and of course it was cheaper....Thank you Amazon!  They were $20.00 each so instead of $60.00 I paid $40.00 for two.  Worth every penny!  The material is very soft.  The padding is not to much but gives you a little boost and covers the cold nipple problems.  This bra does not leave any weird line or crease that shows through fitted tees either.  I would definitely buy again and recommend to others."}

{"label":0,"review":"Very disappointed. Did not fit in the arms and shoulders and has a very different neckline than it does in the photo. It is elastic all the way around and is not squared. The fabric is also very thin and see through. I will be returning it.  For a $45 costume, I was expecting much higher quality."}

{"label":4,"review":"My son and his girlfriend loved this!"}
{"label":1,"review":"Contrary to other reviews, I found this bra to be very unattractive and uncomfortable. First off, the sizing was way off. I found the cups to be shaped weird and the \\\\\"U-Back\\\\\" made the front middle press into my chest. I suppose if you are a larger size (C or greater) you might not have this problem, but the B-cup was very disproportionate (and lumpy). Not a lot of padding either, but it would have been fine if the bra fit better. I returned it."}

{"label":4,"review":"Very cute , bottoms do come a bit higher than the picture - but still below belly button.  Top makes me look a bit flat, but the whole thing had an all over slimming affect, so that did not bother me.  I used their measurements, but wished I had ordered one size bigger."}

The only negative thing is that they're see through, though it's nothing that can't be solved with a pair of black leggings underneath. Overall it's a great product and definitely worth the price"}
{"label":4,"review":"Fits just right, very comfortable for a long day. (hard to believe, it's pretty tight)<br \/><br \/>Totally flatten my belly.<br \/><br \/>This smoother makes the difference between a size 12 and a 10. I fit into the 10's, but the waist was so tight, I felt like I couldn't breathe.

{"label":4,"review":"Needed suspenders for a Tux (no adjustment on the waist and no belt loops, because it's a tux.)  The included buttons are white but that really doesn't matter because they don't show.  This fit well on me (I'm 6'4&#34;) with room to spare on the adjuster.  They look great so I can wear them with or without a vest.  The subtle zig zag pattern looks sharp.  Now I just need to get some more buttons so I can use them with my suits."}

The Theater company had purchased similar wigs, but the show was double cast and the kids had to share wigs. Lice was going around several area schools and in order to limit our exposure, I ordered this wig from Amazon... it was a small price to pay to avoid the lice headache! I will say, this wig runs small. It fit my 6 year old perfectly. So, if you are an adult with a large head, this may not be the wig for you. However, if you are a smaller person in need of blue hair for a few hours, this is the wig for you!"}

{"label":4,"review":"I am very happy with this product and wore the entire first day I received it. The fact that there is a word requirement for my reviews is absurd."}
{"label":4,"review":"What a great novelty item. Very durable, thin, spacious compartments for cash, receipts, notes, etc. Two card slots inside (doesn't hold ALL of my cards, but it holds the important ones - credit card, bank card, ID card, Metrocard, etc). I wouldn't use the outside pockets for anything important as things slide out from there too easily unless you secure them with something like tape or a paperclip.    This wallet looks just like a folded map...sometimes I worry that I'll lose it because it looks so authentic. The other Mighty Wallet themes are awesome too, there are many to choose from & it's hard to pick. It's a bit expensive for a plasticized paper wallet but the idea is unique.    Fun wallet for traveling light. It's waterproof & doesn't bulge a pocket or purse the way regular bulky wallets do. The only thing it doesn't hold is coins."}
{"label":4,"review":"I was very excited when I got this in the mail. The delivery processes was quick and smooth.<br \/>I had to buy the largest size (XL). My size is exactly like their size chart.<br \/>They unfortunately are a little to small. I like when the  &#34;crotch area&#34; on my pants\/leggins are actually up to my &#34;crotch area&#34;, but these leggings won't let me pull them up far enough. Because of that factor, I am very restricted in my movements. I just make sure to be extra careful when sitting.<br \/>They are very pretty and I hope that if I continue to loose weight, they will fit in no time :)"}

The only thing is if you wear larger than a B cup - the coverage of your breasts is NOT going to be there. I guess it's a matter of taste. Beautifully opaque, not cheap sheer. The quality is pretty good although it took FOREVER to receive it. I ditched the thong and bought matching lace panties from FOH.<br \/>Very pretty - sexy and feminine..."}

Keeps close and doesn't get all stretched out. (if you have a big neck for your size, say from pumping iron, not sure how you would deal ~ maybe just fine. IDK. I would recommend this to anyone, with the caveat that it is not as soft as some shirts you may like. I am hoping in time, it will soften with use and washing."}

It was SO worth it - these are my favorite pants of all time \u2026 this is my second pair and if I'd been able to find 6 more I'd have bought them as well so vexed am I at the prospect of doing without!  They've got a little more stretch than other NYDJ jeans & I suspect the additional &#34;give&#34; as they age is from the coating diminishing.  They're such a great color to go with so many things and they're cool - as in temperature - much cooler to the touch (both leg and hand) than other jeans.  I can't say enough about the versatility & comfort of this particular NYDJ!!!"}
{"label":2,"review":"I really loved the color and the design of the bodice, but it just didn't fit correctly. I had a hard time pulling the corset closed, and once I did, I found that I still had extra fabric that my bust didn't fill out. This is a very unusual problem for me, for I'm am very busty. The quality was great, it just seemed the proportions were wrong."}
{"label":2,"review":"I have had this shirt for a couple of weeks now. While it keeps my boy from getting sunburned (the goal) it is not holding up as well as I thought is should or other shirts I have purchased from different brands have in the past. I was concerned that it only had a spf of 50 and not 100 like many other brands. He is not getting burned so that is now not a concern for me.  The seams on the shoulder and neckline are fraying and fuzzy. The logo on the front is already starting to peel. I expected to last longer than a month before it started looking so worn!  The shirt is staying together and doing its job, so I can't complain about that. Another odd thing about the shirt is the length of the sleeves! They are soo long that they come down over my sons hands by 4 inches, and he has longs arms! We just roll them up and he is fine.<br \/><br \/>I don't think I would purchase this shirt again for a few dollars more I can get a 100spf from Costco that will hold up through many children and not just 1!"}

{"label":3,"review":"I loved the looks of the dress when I ordered it. I received it in a timely manor. It was beautiful on my daughter. The only downfall about this dress, was the way it was made.. Under the layers of &#34;ruffles&#34;, you could see thread upon thread upon thread. From it being made like this, the zipper only went half way down from where it was supposed to go. Thank goodness I have a small (thin) baby girl because if she was a &#34;chunker,&#34; I would not have been able to get it on her. Overall it worked! It was reasonably priced. Dresses in &#34;usa&#34; like this one, would have costed 30-40 even 50 dollars!!! It did it's job."}

But if you are anything above those sizes... even if you're taller than 5'6 it might start to get tight. I'm super happy with the purchase though. Its a bit of a pain to put on and off too with the attached garter."}
{"label":3,"review":"The pants is good, but I wonder that I can change the size or not. Because the size was unsuitable when I got it."}
{"label":2,"review":"I usually wear a M or L so I went ahead and got am XL anticipating it to be small. I'm a 38d... well I felt like I was going to break the shirt. The material it self is shiffon. Very thin of course. The color and pattern are pretty. I end up giving it to my daughter. 13yrs old and still wears 12\/14 kids clothing."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great shirt. Highly recommended"}
{"label":4,"review":"This fit great and I love the design!  I don't think I can ever get enough stuff that says how proud I am of my soldiers!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I really like this dress; it's very flattering worn if worn with tie wrapped around as shown in the orange and white dress vs. the other option of pinching all of the fabric and tied in front as shown in the other fabric patterns offered.  I'm a little heavier in my tummy area these days and this dress is surprisingly very flattering on, despite the thin fabric.  The top is lined so to speak - under the draping, you have a double layer deep V tank out of the same fabric, which is also double layered so you don't need a bra (unless you require lift).  It does run large - I purchased the small and had to have the inside tank area in the front lifted a bit because it was a little droopy on me.  I'm 5'2 - 130 lbs. with a 32-33 barely B chest.  I generally prefer deep V style dresses and tops on smaller busted women vs. larger busted women.  I also had to have the hem taken up a little as well, so that the length is as shown in the picture.  This dress is very comfortable and can be dressed up or down.  I purchased this to wear to a wedding in Fl. beginning of June.  I am pairing this with gold sandals."}
{"label":4,"review":"My wife really likes this!  The colors are bright, but not too bright and blend together well.  Very nicely sewn and stylish for exercise.  The fabric is soft and comfy.  Size of this is a little larger than a small and since my wife usually wears a medium, this small is more of a medium than a small.  Very good item for the summer!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Lovely soft colored scarf. Goes great with several different colored shirts. The chevron print is fabulous with these colors together"}
{"label":4,"review":"Overall the bra fits as expected and is comfortable, but the cups are a little weird. The material is thin and they are not as round or smooth as most bras I own. They seem pointier than most. This is my first nursing bra so it will work to get me started, but I will probably keep shopping for a better fit.  Edit: I've been wearing this bra for a while now and I'm completely satisfied! It is comfortable, easy to use, and overall looks good. The cup shape is not an issue. Now that I am actually breastfeeding, the bra cups fit well. I've just ordered a second bra in another color."}
{"label":4,"review":"wish you still had the bonehead caps with the barbed wire"}
{"label":2,"review":"The leather on the wallet is thinner than I expected.  It has a lot of storage which is great.  The chain looks strong but after comparing to what I had on my other wallet, the chain was small\/weak.  I ended up swapping it out for my old chain.  I notice a small tear at the fold next to the ring wear the chain connects.  That's not a good sign considering how much I paid for this wallet.  My old wallet had the same amount of items but with no such issue.  I am going to contact the seller for options.  I did like the wallet until this happen."}
{"label":2,"review":"A little too small compared to U.S. sizing but nice."}
{"label":4,"review":"So beautiful!  So far I'm completely in love with this case.  It looks exactly like the picture and I couldn't wait once I got it in my hands.  I love the red interior when you open it up.  It feels pretty sturdy to me and it holds my sunglasses just fine.  Lovely."}

{"label":2,"review":"Says large but its more like a medium, very short"}
{"label":4,"review":"This coat was ordered for my 2 year old daughter and it just arrived and I couldn't be more pleased! It is just adorable! It is really soft like a stuffed animal feels and the inside is a marshmellow feel and really cozy. She looks like a princess in it and I can't wait to leave Florida and travel up north to show it off to all of her Aunts and Uncles there. I know it will keep her nice and warm.The fit is perfect and she can wear clothes under it without it being too snug.What a great purchase!"}
{"label":0,"review":"This is a cheaply made costume. As I was putting it on the zipper broke. I was unable to wear the costume which was frustrating."}
{"label":4,"review":"As with all Aventura shorts\/pants these run very large. So go down a size if you are between sizes. Once you know what size you wear you can confidently buy the same size in other styles. Very soft, fit low on the waist. Comfortable!!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Great shirt, have received compliments, Hanes quality"}
{"label":0,"review":"NOT ANYTHING LIKE THE PHOTO, except maybe the color of the vest. The entire costume is cheap and not made for an adult.  Flimsy fabric, awful hat with what was described as pirate dreads...well lets just say 2 pieces of yellow knotted string sewn to each side of the droopy pathetic hat, is not dreads!  And to make matters even worse, try to return it.  They attempt to charge a 20% re-stocking fee which is not mentioned (of course) anywhere on the purchase website."}
{"label":2,"review":"too expensive"}
{"label":3,"review":"I really liked the jacket I just wished I could of got a bigger size."}
{"label":3,"review":"A winner according to my kid. Great for every day use. Nice cottony feel. He tells me that the calf can feel a bit snug when he first puts them on. However they do become comfy very quickly. He isn't the type to give 5 stars. However he really likes them very much and is very pleased that I got them for him."}
{"label":4,"review":"My husband has been wearing this to work and is very pleased. Light weight so it doesn't get in the way. Good quality, fit was perfect. Provides nice amount of warmth to supplement other layers."}
{"label":4,"review":"Expensive? Yes.  On sale? Worth the price.  The clothing is comfortable, made well and does not shrink so it holds its shape and is durable. This saves money in the long run as you don't have to replace items as often."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very comfortable and doesnt feel contraining on the rib cage. I wish the company will create similar fit in Camisole Style, I will be purchasing more of this the fact that it is fairly price, high quality material and the luxurious comfort it offers."}
{"label":3,"review":"This is a nice flleece. It fits well, however for my daughter the lenth is a bit short, but overall it's fine.<br \/>Very nice for the fall season."}
{"label":2,"review":"the shirt runs small and I needed to use lots of fabric anti-static spray looks great in the photo kind of cheap looking once you get it and put it on."}
{"label":4,"review":"I was actually really impressed with these shorts.  I am a long-time runner, but am training for my first marathon; these shorts had the breathability that I needed and - more importantly - prevented any &#34;chaffing&#34; that is a dangerous proposition (any male runner knows what I'm talking about).  Plus, pockets!  The most understated of additions to running shorts.  Would definitely buy again"}
{"label":3,"review":"Love it ,fit good"}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this for my 1st child, and have purchased one for every kid since. Adjustable, fits my 1-year-old, but my 7-year-old still fits the one we got her at 1 1\/2 too! And we live in Hawaii by the beach, so these things have been repeatedly exposed to the elements and the washing machine and dryer, and they have held up really well. Some people say the brim is too wide, but my kids never minded, I just made sure it was snug on their heads and let them charge the shore break :)"}
{"label":4,"review":"Muy Bueno"}
{"label":4,"review":"It's so versitle. This fit her at 6mo and still fits her at 8mo, it goes will almost everything and is thin enough to fit under her big winter hats."}
{"label":4,"review":"Most comfy! Love the wider waistband. Does not dig into your skin like others"}
{"label":4,"review":"Using this costume for my sons halloween. It is so adorable. Easy to put on and great quality.  Shipping was fast, I'm very satisfied"}
{"label":4,"review":"Love the color choices, fabric and best part is the adjustment string it has for head so your kids can grown in to it without being too tight or too big."}
{"label":3,"review":"The hoodie is cozy and will keep you warm on a chilly night. The only downside to the otherwise awesome design is that the yarn for the mane has a tendency to flop into the in your face and eyes.<br \/>*The zipper pull is super cool!"}
{"label":3,"review":"nice"}
{"label":1,"review":"The main reason i bought this set was because i loved the way the tutu looks, well little did i know this thing is super floppy! It's ok, the set but i was truly disappointed because it's not what i payed for i coulda bought a really awesome tutu for that price!! I gave it a 2 because i liked the leggings, that's it!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought it as a Beret but it runs to large as a beret. However, I still love it ! The cream color looks perfect in winter time. It feels worm and soft. I will recommend it as a hat but not a beret"}
{"label":4,"review":"This leggings fits well and the fabric has a nice feel and seems strong. The top goes up to my waist and stays in tact; it does not roll down."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very pleased with the purchase of this shirt, elegant design and very vivid color. Van Heusen is one of my favorites brands,highly recommend this shirt and brand."}
{"label":3,"review":"These pants are no frills, which is fine with me as I mainly use them for my kid's sleepwear.  They are a little large, but they leave plenty of room to grow into.  I also bought the 0-3 months set, and am still using them at 4 months without issue (and I have a big kid).  I'm guessing these will likely work until 12 months"}
{"label":1,"review":"Cute belt but the buckle broke shortly after I bought it. It was just very wore down and I had not even worn the belt that often"}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought this for my daughters 8th b-day. She wears a 8-10 so I bought the 10 hoping she can grow into it a bit. It fit perfectly right out of the box but after I washed it once it did shrink. She can still wear it but its a tad too short for my liking now. Its a weekend outfit now for sure. The color is beautiful and stayed true even after washing, the fabric is also very good and held up through the washings. I would buy again just in  size or two bigger next time."}
{"label":4,"review":"I am absolutely pleased with these jeans. I love the look, the fit and they are very comfy. After seeing these on FB I had to have them. Great price, great fit just really great jeans."}
{"label":3,"review":"The jacket is silk with a pretty contrast green lining, and the colors are vibrant and jewel like. The fit and style is very good, like a Minkoff jacket, but the problem is that the print is so busy that you have to make up your mind if you love it or hate it. I really wanted to keep this jacket at such a throwaway price, but I knew that I would have found excuses to avoid wearing it, so am returning it. I'll settle for a muted color\/print next time."}
{"label":4,"review":"This bra is my favorite for at least 5 years now. I can't find anything else that fits me as well. Of course this is different for everyone... It is very comfortable and flattering. The only point against it is that the padding is a little hot in hot weather, and also not great for exercising, but the same could be said for any lined bra I suppose. It's very hard to find this in stores, since most stores that carry Wonderbra only stock the push-up kind. This is a regular, lined T-shirt bra that works well with full figures."}
{"label":4,"review":"look great, fit great, arrived on time"}
{"label":4,"review":"I purchased a Bounce Free bra a few months ago and have been thrilled with it.  It is so comfortable to wear, even all day.  Easy to get into and out of.  Hand washes beautifully and the ability to adjust the compression is wonderful!!!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Perfection"}
{"label":2,"review":"I love the Jesus piece. the chain complemented the pendant excellent.  however the pendant was too simple and lack craftsmanship."}
{"label":3,"review":"It's a great size with lots of card slots. Has room for my cell. But, it does have an awful odor, probably from packaging. I had to let it air out for about a week but it was well worth the wait."}
{"label":2,"review":"Does not fit me well.."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love these hose!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Great quality fits all hair types! I went from long hair to really short and it still looks good. Cute to cover up bad hair day but not too bulky."}
{"label":1,"review":"Item is way too small and I even bought a size larger than I normally wear."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love this bra! Very well made, and was exactly as described. I will definitely buy this brand again."}
{"label":3,"review":"I jus love this!  My daughter is so adorable in it"}
{"label":3,"review":"True to size, compression style sports bra. Comfortable."}
{"label":4,"review":"I was a bit skeptical, but I'm so glad I purchased this. I bought a navy one to go with a spring dress I wore to attend a wedding, and it was perfect. Fancy enough, but also practical. I just placed an order for a black one and a white one, just so I can have them on hand for other outfits."}
{"label":2,"review":"they work. i got medium's. being a 6'3&#34; dude, tall and skinny. So these being unisex they are narrow and would fit right but are a little too short for my height. Larges may have been better but then i feel like i swim in the fabric because they are too wide. they worked though for school as there are not very many red scrubs for men out there."}
{"label":4,"review":"I really love the feel & look of this blouse, saving it for a special occasion."}
{"label":4,"review":"My daughter was excited when I told her I order these pants for her. It took a while for the order to get in but she got them Monday, tried them on and they look really good.  My concern was the length, because she\u2019s small in size but pretty tall.  They fit wonderful and the length was perfect.  They\u2019re a great quality and really comfortable!  She washed them and wore them today. She says it feels like she\u2019s wearing her pj\u2019s and when she busted a move she was too excited about the roominess of them.  I wished they came in other colors, I would so order her another pair for Christmas."}
{"label":2,"review":"I don't know what they consider extra large, but this is not it. Fabric is comfortable, but fit is terrible."}
{"label":4,"review":"This shirt is exactly as is it is pictured\/described and it fits and washes well. I would definitely purchase this item again from here."}
{"label":1,"review":"I spoke with one of the owners of Daylight Sales and they are working to correct this... however, at the present time, I wouldn't buy this, until it is \\\\\"prototypically\\\\\" correct.  The Richmond Fredericksburg & Potomac was created as a Railroad, and stayed a Railroad, not a Railway until it's absorption by CSX in late 1991.<br \/><br \/>The gentleman I spoke with was very apologetic and said they would get on correcting this some time this summer and will reissue.  If it is still as crisp as this looks, and correct, then they will get a sale from me.  I hope you will too."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love it"}
{"label":4,"review":"My son likes the shirt. Good quality and the sizing was accurate."}
{"label":2,"review":"I purchase this for me, the first weeks went perfectly, but after 1 month one of the clips go wrong and it doesn\u00b4t adjust any more."}
{"label":4,"review":"ADORABLE on my granddaughter. GREAT COLOR too!!!"}
{"label":3,"review":"This looks very nice, pretty much exactly as pictured. The only problem I have is the eyes seem too close together, my eye is not centered in the eyehole. Also the part on the bridge of the nose is off center, making my nose look crooked. I am a little afraid to try to bend it so it is more centered, but I might try. Otherwise, beautiful mask, I think it will look great on some people depending on the shape of your face."}
{"label":4,"review":"this is so cute and was so cheap i love this outfit and so does my husband its amazing and very sexy"}
{"label":4,"review":"... cuff!!! Yes, because at the end of this easy black stretch denim there's a cuff that makes this pant really nice. And being also very comfortable I'll have no problems to find something to wear with it.<br \/>Don't miss it: it's really nice!!!"}

I was pleasantly surprised to open the packaging and find a pair of thick denim jeans with an adjustable waist. These are very nice jeans and even have a $40 price tag on them. Great quality and I will order more."}

{"label":3,"review":"So when I looked at reviews on this I saw a lot of ppl say to get a size bigger and they were definitely right. I got one size bigger then What the chart says and it's perfect... It's tight for sure but not where I'm like gasping for air. I can still go about my regular routine with out to much discomfort.. It takes some getting used to but  it's not bad at all... I had trouble putting in on my self the first day so my husband helped me but now it's no problem at all. I find it's earlier to put on while laying down and starting from the top hook. I'm on my 3rd day of wearing it 2-4 hours around the house and I'm almost ready for the second row of hooks.. I recently had a baby and my tummy is definitely getting tighter(I put on a caffeine cream under the cincher) I also really like how much it helps my posture( I have slight scoliosis) and my back feels great. The only real con I have on this product is that it gives u a little bit of &#34;back fat&#34; but I expected that so it doesn't bother me that much but like i said definitely get a size bigger. I will with out a doubt be getting another one once I'm ready to go smaller"}

I was so disappointed but well, i guess i got what i paid for. Cheap but hideous quality"}
{"label":4,"review":"I knew that going in, but if you see pageant or bridesmaid on the dress label, you will need a slip to show like it does on amazon. If you don't want to pay the high price for a bridal slip, you can use a tutu but make sure it is long enough to meet near the end of the dress, or it will only poof out at the top and look stupid.  It is stunning in person.. much more soft and shiny than I had expected. I got the pink one too lol."}

{"label":2,"review":"The pants feel like normal-weight linen material, but is not super soft.  They're pretty scratchy straight out of the box, and with one washing they've softened up a bit, but I would still describe them as somewhat scratchy.  In terms of fit: I'm not super skinny, but I have no hips; I went with a small thinking the waist should fit snugly (based on the size chart), but the hips would be loose.  Now that I have the pants, the hips are still loose, but so is the waist.  The stretchy fold over band has plenty more room to stretch, and if it were slightly tighter, I think the pants would stay up better.  I have to pull them up every once in while."}

I needed a sock that would not stretch out and fall down after a couple hours of wearing,  would not developed wear holes and most importantly would comfortably protect my lower leg from bugs, the sun and the weather.

{"label":2,"review":"I usually do a pro\/con type review, but this product really didn't have outstanding pros or cons, mostly just considerations. So, I'll list them in the form of personal experience:<br \/><br \/>-The fabric is as labeled micro modal + spandex. Compared to other micro modal blended clothing, the feel of the fabric does have a silkier\/smoother feel versus the textured and matted cotton feel of micro modal + cotton blends. So, these trunks are extremely soft. I personally liked this about the fabric. Fabric feels cool, even in 80 degrees+ weather.<br \/><br \/>-The complaints about sizing tend to be quite accurate. I'm a 34 inch waist, and bought a medium, what I usually wear. The size chart said the small would be a better fit, but given other reviews, I went up in size and bought medium (supposedly meant for a 36-38 inch waist). Even having done that, they still are somewhat small. The micro modal fabric does have a very forgiving stretch to it, but I can feel that it's somewhat constricting. Had I gone up to a large, it might have been a better fit, which is why I said I don't have significant pros\/cons, just considerations.<br \/><br \/>-Like many other reviewers have said, these do ride up. They ride up, A LOT. I can't wear them for longer than 20 minutes because they ride up, even from something simple as standing up from being seated. Briefs\/trunks ride up, it's inevitable. But, I've never experienced this much discomfort from underwear riding up from briefs and trunks of better quality and even lower quality brands. They're extremely uncomfortable. With that said, I do think they're decent to wear for sleep. They still ride up through the course of the night, but given I'm asleep, it doesn't bother me to the point where my sleep is ruined. If I had sized up to a large, they probably would have ridden up even more.<br \/><br \/>-However, even with them riding up, and being somewhat small, I felt there was still adequate room in the groin, which is great. But, there is odd stitching that goes down the center of the front that, in certain moments, you can feel, and it feels a bit awkward. Also, my thighs aren't massive, but there's enough muscle on them from being an athlete. Even with that, the trunks stretch over the top of my thighs (since that's where trunks are supposed to stop at) just fine.<br \/><br \/>-The waistband is only about 1\/2 inch, compared to 1 to 1.5 inch of many other briefs and trunks. Since I'm only about 5'7, this makes them much more comfortable around the waist for me. But, given that the sizing was a little small on me, the waistband does feel a bit tighter. Maybe going up one more size might have made them perfectly comfortable. There is also a tag on the back that is long and uncomfortable. Careful about tearing it off as this fabric is very thin.<br \/><br \/>-Their durability and longevity will be updated at a later time. But, after a couple washs, they're holding up. No holes, no shrinkage, no loss in shape.<br \/><br \/>-In terms of how they look, I personally like how they look, before they ride up. I got them in black, and they're very flattering. But, as soon as they ride up, they look quite awkward, almost to the point where someone else looking at them can sense your own discomfort with them.<br \/><br \/>I've heard people say bulk pack clothing tend to be of less quality. I'm a believer of that claim, now. A lot of people rave about these trunks because upgrading from Hanes is still a jump in quality, but these trunks are still only among the middle tier of underwear. Without a direct comparison to other options available, I will say this: these trunks come out to ~$7 each, which translates to be better than ~$2 per Hanes briefs, but far below something like $20 CK micro modal briefs\/trunks. If you haven't experienced high quality underwear (and clothing), mediocre quality may be the best you know, which becomes ignorance that is bliss. Given all those considerations, if you're looking to delve into highquality underwear, or expect that level quality, these trunks aren't quite there. But as I said, they're not bad. They're acceptable if fair quality is all you want, or something decent to sleep in. They're also good to test the waters with and see if buying higher quality is even something worthwhile for you since these trunks give you a decent idea of what's available beyond something like Hanes and Fruit of the Loom.<br \/><br \/>Ultimately, I think they're decent. Maybe my experience could have been different, perhaps better, if I had went up one more size. Since I can't exchange them, I'm stuck with having taken the gamble at medium and not getting what I expected, yielding this review\/experience. I'm forced to settle for wearing them while sleeping; they're comfortable enough and the fabric feels great. But, with experiencing sizing problems and riding up so much for this brand, individually sold briefs are now justified to me at $20\/ea . Depending on the expectations, you get what you pay for, and cost savings can still mean you end up paying in other ways. Given what I was hoping to get, these trunks are a great example of that, in my opinion. Others out there may be perfectly okay with how these trunks perform for them. That's great. For me, unfortunately, it wasn't.quality underwear, or expect that level quality, these trunks aren't quite there. But as I said, they're not bad.

{"label":4,"review":"I'm usually somewhere between a JM and a JL (between a women's small and medium), and after reading a review that this top ran really small, I chose to get the large. It fits me perfectly fine. I'm pretty positive that I could've gotten the medium and still would've been fine, but I don't really mind the slightly looser fit. Also, another reviewer said that the top was shorter than the picture shows, and again I would disagree. I mean, yes, it's short, but it's supposed to be. It looks the same length in the picture and in person. The only other thing I would say is that the bottom of the shirt isn't as tight as it looks in the picture. I was expecting it to be tighter or even somewhat elastic, but it isn't. It does go in at the waist, but not as much as the picture shows. Even if I had gotten a medium, I think it still would've been a little loose at the waist."}

{"label":3,"review":"So to begin with, you need a very specific body type to pull this off. It was just not flattering on me, and the boob part was just constantly coming off. I'm not sure if it's just because of how it's cut and that it would act like this on everyone or if it's just because I have no boobs, I'm inclined to think it might act like this on everyone to some extent but if you have more substance in the cleavage department that it might help a little (either way it's nothing some tape shouldn't be able to fix). I'm 5'8, 140lbs, 36b, and usually a medium in tops and a large in leggings (smaller ones are just too short). 5 or 6 in pants, and I think a 29 although I haven't had anything sized that way in years. I bought a large in this and it was the proper size for me, a bit of camel toe effect but minimal and it could be solved with the strategic use of a pantyliner (personally one of my favorite fashion tricks).  Unfortunately I don't have much of anything in the hip department either, maybe if I had either hips or boobs, at least one of the two, this might've looked pretty good, but I don't so it just looked silly. It did improve when I stuck a cute long sleeved hooded crop top on top of it, so there is always that option if you end up getting this and it doesn't flatter you either, and you can also put shorts on top of it along with the crop top to further cover up any unsightly bulges while still having an interesting vaguely out-of-the-box type look if shipping costs make returning it nonsensical.  I gave it four stars because while it didn't look good on me, it DID look like it did in the picture, I just don't have the right body for it, and the fabric feels really nice and silky and has a good amount of stretch to it, and the legs were actually long enough for me which is not the case a lot of the time (also the butt part did look really good, but it just wasn't enough to salvage this for me).  If you have proportions similar to the woman in the picture (or if you atleast have nice hips) then get this, along with some fashion tape and pantyliners :) if you don't you might end up disliking this but it can be repurposed to serve as something interesting to wear underneath a different outfit to switch things up.  Good luck :)  UPDATE: Added a couple pictures for reference, I wore a bra under it and then covered that with my hand\/phone for modesty purposes but it should give at least a general idea of what it looks like"}
{"label":4,"review":"A nursing bra that fits! I felt like bursting into song when I tried this bra on in the store.  I bought 2 other bras before the baby came and was advised to buy them 2 to 3 sizes bigger.  Horrible advice!  I was making due with regular sports bras when I stumbled on this in a little shop.  Following the clerk's advice, I selected the size I was pre-pregnancy.  Kismet!  It's easy to unlatch and feed the baby.  The bra is extremely comfortable, looks good under a shirt--a little lift, no flattening.  The straps are easy to adjust.  I only have one and I use it all the time--even as a swimsuit top since my normal one doesn't fit again yet.  It's given me nothing but satisfaction.  I wish they came in other colors, but I'm too happy to fault them for it.  Well worth $40!"}

I hate shopping for clothing!  This piece of clothing came with a metal tag announcing the brand; this is not a replacement for cutting clothes according to size charts!  Okay this is an update to be fair about these pants.  They have what they call &#34;compression fit&#34;.  What that means is that the pull on pants compress enough that they lie flat at your waist after you pull them on unlike traditional pull on pants that have an accordion of gathers at the waste.  That being said, I am between a medium and a large on most clothes - if I was a full on large, I would find these a bit uncomfortable.  someone asked if they cling: the pants lay nicely.

{"label":4,"review":"I own several Lucky Brand tops. They tend to be very soft and lightweight, and this one is no exception.  Because it is black, I don't find it to be sheer at all.  I tried it on with a nude bra, and the bra and bra straps were not visible or noticeable.  The lace detailing is quite beautiful and keeps it from being yet another boring black top in my collection. Compared to other Lucky tops I own, this one is cut more fitted and less blousy.  I will agree with the previous reviewer that this top isn't cut for a tall person.  I am 5'5\\\\\" and the length and proportions are just right for me. I plan on wearing this top with skinny jeans and tall boots this Fall.<br \/><br \/>A word of caution: Lucky Brand tops are a bit delicate.  So, regardless of what the tags say, I always wash them on the cold\/hand wash setting and lay them flat to dry. They hold up just fine with proper care.  I personally love that Lucky uses nice soft cotton and other non-synthetics in their clothes.  That is something that drives me crazy about plus size clothing.  I absolutely hate shiny, stretchy synthetic fabrics (like heavy polyesters and lycra) and if you go into most plus size retailers, that's what their stores are full of. I also love that Lucky Brand makes the same tops in regular and plus size. I personally wouldn't pay full price for designer clothes, but at clearance prices, I think Lucky Brand clothes are a steal."}

It blows off quite easily with strong gusts; it would great if I could tighten it around my face. It keeps me pretty warm in the 30s (F) as long as you are wearing warm clothing."}

The quality of the blazer jacket is excellent and I love the style.  The inside of the jacket also has a cool checkered pattern which I actually love and the jacket itsef just looks phenomenal.

Thankfully I read the review and another plus size purchaser commented that she was happy with the fit so I decided to give it a go and I must say I'm happy that I did. It's beautiful!

{"label":4,"review":"I purchased this hat for my trip to Mexico.  In Mexico, you definitely need a hat to block out the blazing sun.  My hat was so good in blocking out the sun that my boyfriend took it from me to get relief from the sun.  I bought more than one type of hat and wind up wearing this one most of the time because it was cool (due to the cotton) and it was easy to fold and put into my bag unlike the other hats. Something you don't think of until you get there. What I find cool about this hat is that you can wear it more than one way.  I would recommend this Safari Hat for anyone.  One more thing, when I first purchased this hat, there was a defect in one of the buttons and Luxury Divas was quick and fast in sending me a new replacement hat before my trip.  I would recommend both the hat and the vendor."}
{"label":1,"review":"I didn't like it at all.  I returned it.  If I had tried it on at a store first I would have never spent money on it in the first place.  I am sure someone else with a different body type might have loved it, but I wasn't about to suffer through wearing a bra that didn't fit me properly."}

{"label":3,"review":"I really like this shirt because it's flattering and is lightweight enough to be worn in the spring\/summer with a bandeau underneath, however the sleeves aren't elastic at the end and they are kind of restricting. But the good outweighs the con."}

The maker of the cap is RothCo., some off beat company, the craftsmanship of it is really cheap. I recommend that you look somewhere else. Do not shop at this store.

{"label":4,"review":"I bought this top with my 14 year old sister in mind and it fit her perfectly.  It's a junior fit which means it fits a junior's frame it's not measured the same as a full women's frame.  She is 5'4 and light weight so I went with the medium and it fit perfectly.  (All my orders from SouthPole juniors fit her perfectly. Even me and I'm an extra small in Womens)<br \/>The color is vibrant and the fabric is so soft, it is lightly transparent but that is visible if you zoom in which  makes the fabric take on a dragon scale effect (a huge plus as to why we wanted this shirt)<br \/>Free shipping took about 3 days to get from IL, to CA.<br \/>All in all a great experience I would recommend this particular top to anyone who loves the lace effect and smooth fabric!"}

The sleeves feel about 2-3 inches too short for me even when I'm just standing with my arms at my sides. I've tried getting every size between Large to Triple X size shirts to see if they would have longer sleeves, if the Triple X would have had longer sleeves I would gladly pay for a taylor to make the body fit properly, but unfortunately the sleeves are a one size for all.     The shirts are all quality made, and I loved to color selection. Unfortunately for me they just didn't fit, so I dropped them off to Goodwill"}
{"label":2,"review":"These are super cute socks, but I would say that they run very small.  Purchased them for my son when he was one and they were a pretty tight fit then and he does not have especially large feet.  Definitely wouldn't last up to 24 months."}

{"label":2,"review":"fit nicely and very comfortable. Only problem is black ones once washed they get little fuzz balls on them.  So I will try getting a more expensive ones next time to see if the quality does not do this.  Anyways I just use them ones to wear under my jeans in the winter for extra warmth.  They work out great as under garments in Maine."}
{"label":4,"review":"these are great! love the cotton-y feel and the heel grip helps keep them in place. I like how low on the toes they fit since my shoes have &#34;cut outs&#34; that show the base of my toes. and they are low enough not to show on the sides+heels. the heel grip helps keep them in place. I walked quite a bit today and they didn't slip at all. I wear women's size 9 (euro size 40) and purchased the small due to other reviews saying they ran large. they fit great perfectly."}

The fabric is as comfy or MORE than UA and the buttons in the front are larger and don't pop out when you're junk flops around.  These are HALF the price and twice the quality"}

The only problem is once you hit an 8 reg for boys, you no longer have an adjustable waistband.  My son is not too tall and super skinny, so I can't understand why they think he would no longer require an adjustable waistband?"}

This blend is perfect. I bought more than six. My husband loves them too, so I bought him a few. Also, of less concern to me, they don't fade, shrink much or lose their shape or initial appearance. They feel like an extremely soft fine cotton."}

So thin that I won't get away without an undershirt as I did sometimes with my more expensive shirts. That was probably a bad habit, anyway. Sizing info accurate (I'm used to more finer sizing as one sees on the more expensive shirts -- the rougher sizing here is close enough for me). For the price, 5 stars."}

The cut of the legs was at my shins without even being able to get my head through the neck hole, where this is advertised as being &#34;long&#34; and &#34;ankle length.&#34; It's not bad fabric for polyester (didn't seem see-through at all) and the style is super cute. If you're very short, I would recommend this jumpsuit. However, I'm 5'9&#34; and a size 6\/8 and there was no way this fits anyone over MAYBE 5'5&#34;.

{"label":4,"review":"Fits well.<br \/>Only for your information, the fabric is a little bit thick, so this makes the short a little bit heavy.  I don't mean that the weight is a problem, I just want you to know that is not a light short just in case you were imagining that."}

{"label":3,"review":"The raincoat is very nice. I'm 5'4 so if youre shorter than me you might want to wear heels with it because it will be dragging the floor. The raincoat came a little above my ankles. But it does give full coverage so your clothes won't get wet. I got a size medium which I could've gotten a small based on the length of the sleeves but I wanted some room in my waist area. The straps on the wrist could be button at different lengths due to the two buttons on the sleeve that makes it adjustable. The sleeves were kind of long which didn't bother me Too much.  The pockets are very deep and the buttons down the middle are covered to reduce wear and tear. You can wear the hood either fitted or loose. Now the only thing I didn't like is the drawstring around the waist.  Actually I wouldnt call it a drawstring. It's the same type of material as the raincoat that's suppose to make a tighter fit around the waist. Well the string was too short and I had to untie the knots on each end to make it longer. The only thing I would suggest is to make the string longer to where someone can adjust how tight and loose they may want it. Other than that's it's very nice and would consider buying it in other colors. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and all opinions are mine."}
{"label":0,"review":"The concept of this product is good, however the planning and construction are not. I figured I would give them a try, and ordered 2. I opened the first box and thought: \\\\\"holy mess\\\\\"...<br \/><br \/>1. The hood, filter, and fan module were crammed into the box, and I could see where a previous reviewer described the hood being all crumpled. Upon closer inspection, the crumpled hood was less of a concern for me, as I found the 3 adjustment straps for the head webbing went completely through the outer shell to buckles on the outside. This, leaving obvious holes for any NBC agent to enter.<br \/><br \/>2. This is supposed to be for a child. I tried it on many, from a 4 year old to a 10 year old, and it did not fit any of them. So I decided to try it myself. It would not even fit me, and I'm not a small guy. It was too long to adjust for my neck. With this problem, I could never see a child wearing this for more than 2 minutes before trying to rip it off, this nullifying any positive effect it could bring.<br \/><br \/> 3. This is advertised to last 14 hours without a battery change. If I'm not mistaken, the canister filters themselves don't last that long.<br \/><br \/>4. It doesn't look anything like the picture, at least I couldn't get it to. In addition, it smelled musty and had what seemed to be an oily film on some of it.<br \/><br \/>After all that, just don't waste your time and money on this one."}

We ordered the green one and the green\/black one this time thinking it would be the same shirt in a different color. We ordered it off the same page and everything. The first one was the more snug fit, which is what we wanted. The second order, however, was more like the t-shirt fit. It is much looser.

{"label":0,"review":"I got these boot tops as part of a super hero costume I made for Halloween and was very excited when I found them - they were exactly what I was looking for.  They turned out to be a real disappointment.  The upper edge of both boot tops ripped the first time I tried them on because they're shoddily made.  They're very hot to wear, they slide down your legs constantly (I was wearing tights, but I tried them on without tights and they did the same thing), and they smell so strongly of vinyl it's almost sickening.  By the time I finished wearing them at the one Halloween party I went to, I had to throw them in the trash because they were ripped so badly they looked completely stupid.  These weren't cheap, so I don't think it was asking too much to expect them to last through more than one party.  You'd be better off just wrapping ribbons around your legs instead of buying this product.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"label":4,"review":"Hands down the best and highest quality Halloween costume I have ever bought. The price is amazing, and  you couldn't get something this good at a Halloween store. And if you did so happen to find something like this, you are going to pay an upwards of 60-80 bucks.<br \/><br \/>I'm a size 16-18 and I did realize this is a 16-20 so it is a bit big. But the corset front ties and tightens so it really was no issue for me.<br \/><br \/>I love the way the skirt falls outwards, (Due to the materials underneath) instead of straight down. I find it much more slimming this way.<br \/><br \/>The only thing I don't like is how thin the top is, I was going to wear a blue bra beneath but it showed right though. So I had to go pick up a lower cut white one. Not a big deal really, just a bit of an annoyance to me.<br \/><br \/>All in all, it's a 9\/10<br \/><br \/>p.s. If you're looking for Ruby slippers, the Secret Wishes brand is the best looking. I returned a ( more expensive, yet lower quality ) pair before buying from Secret Wishes."}

They are absolutely opaque enough to wear as leggings, but the seaming on the butt is awkward.  There are 2 seams, one on each butt cheek, like long underwear.  2. I am only 5'3\\\\\" and 120lbs (but with long legs), and the Medium\/Tall fits me perfectly, which means a Small\/Medium would have been too small\/short.  If you like to buy B size tights normally because A is too short, you definitely need the Medium Tall in these.    That said, these are great for tights in the winter, but I would not recommend these to wear as leggings if you like your butt to show a little."}

{"label":2,"review":"I am 6ft tall and 185 lbs. I liked this shirt because it is made of the same material percentages as my favorite shirts from Express (approx 93% cotton and 8%spandex or lycra).  Anyway I ordered these because I thought they would be similar, and I love buying things through Amazon.   This is the first item I have ever returned.    I bought size large. The shirt was too tight for me, while the sleeves were too loose and a bit longer than I prefer. Also the length of the shirt was too short for my tastes, as I like shirts that easily cover my belt, because I don't like to tuck my shirts in.    Lastly the Vneck just felt too big and wide of a Vee.    Is this a terrible shirt? For me it is. But maybe there is someone out there who would love it. My guess is if you are 5ft 8inches or less with a slender muscular frame and big shoulders and arms, and you don't need extra tuck-in length, and you like shirt that hugs and shows off your muscular physique, then maybe this will work for you.    If you are taller and have more of a swimmers body and normal decent looking arms then you may want to try the black Vneck from Express. It will compliment your body nicely without making it obvious that your six pack is not what it used to be, while your physique still looks pretty good. I don't mean to sound like I'm advertising for them, but I just love their shirts so much! Haven't found anything that fits me so perfectly.    Good luck!"}

I agree that the collar may not be as tall as is pictured but it is a work vest. I like that there is a full length storm flap inside the zipper. The zipper is also well covered, when zipped up, which is handy when leaning over auto\/cycle bodywork.  P.S. The outside chest pocket will fit an iPhone 4 and 5 but not the 6 or 6 plus."}

The problem is that the shirt is a mens shirt , a regular 5-6 dollar black shirt, tank-top for men that the quote is printed on. Its fine quality, but wont flatter the woman form by any means, way overpriced because of the shows popularity. :)"}

That slight difference was making me not want to purchase these but I took a chance that the description was wrong and I was so glad that I was right.<br \/><br \/>I'm also very glad I read other reviews on Champions website where customers were stating that their sizes sometimes run a little big so I ordered the small and they are perfect!<br \/><br \/>I'm very happy with these tights.  Even happier that they are made of polyester and NOT nylon.  They cover extremely well, the length is perfect, I love the inside pocket, and they perfect for running in the cold and wind.<br \/><br \/>I looked around and these were the least expensive also."}

I normally wear a \\\\\"large\\\\\" mitten, but had to switch to XL.<br \/><br \/>They were smart to keep as much of the stitching as possible away from the main (palm \/ finger) surfaces that you use, there is only one small bit of stitching in the crook of the thumb that could rip before the deerskin wore through, but there's no way around that.  I expect these to last for many years.<br \/><br \/>I bought an UNLINED pair of these choppers size XXL (2XL) chopper mittens and they fit perfectly around a medium sized pair of [[ASIN:B000V596O0 Fox River Men's Extra Heavy Double Ragg Mitten]] wool liners that I can remove to dry both layers out faster when they get wet.  (The lined version of these choppers provides very little insulation and is really just a protection between your skin and the rough leather.  -I chose the unlined version so that I could pull out the separate wool mitten to dry faster.)<br \/><br \/>This produces a great, warm, tough (the chopper mittens have the smallest amount of seams possible, and none on the palm\/fingers parts that you use), and breathable mitten for working outdoors in the cold.  They're a little bulky, but I can still chop wood, shovel, and work a snow blower just fine (it's just a little tricky trying to start a zipper or something).<br \/><br \/>I'd upload a picture if either vendor allowed me to."}

I had to use lots of force and finally gave up and used black Gorilla Tape to tape the glow sticks to the black costume. The regular connectors (without the pins) work just fine, and it was easy to put the glow sticks into them. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."}

Goes well with button up shirts.<br \/><br \/>I read some 100 reviews before ordering, as I'm not a fan of having to pay a butt load to return stuff.

I workout and lift a decent amount, and normally wear a medium for everything. I ordered it as an American L, so an XL in Korea. FITS LIKE A GLOVE. Had I ordered it as an American medium, I'd have to return it. Read the reviews, seriously."}
{"label":4,"review":"I followed the advice of the previous reviewer and sized up. I ordered an XL (I'm 5'8\/125lb). It fits perfectly and is roomy enough that I can wear a thick sweater underneath it. The jacket itself is well made and a nice change from the standard anorak style. There are plenty of pockets, and the hood is detachable. I do want to caution that even though it is lined, it is NOT a warm coat type of garment. It's lightweight, and you'll need to wear warmer clothes if you plan to use it in cold weather. Overall, I think it's a good buy and would recommend it for those who are looking for a lighter option for fall\/spring."}

After a whole season of using this product, I am completely confident that my problems are solved.<br \/><br \/>They are a little tricky to use at first, but once you figure out the proper location to clip in the back and pin it securely in place, they are a breeze to work with.  Great invention! Can't thank the owner enough for coming up with such a phenomenal and fashionable solution =)<br \/><br \/>Works great with strapless, and one shoulder tops.  To utilize this product in the fall or colder weather, you can wear them with an of the shoulder sweater (shell underneath) with pretty earrings in lieu of a necklace."}

The 517 \\\\\"cut\\\\\" fits me well, and it does on these 2 pair as well; but that's the only positive thing about them. What's wrong? Where do I start? Over 2 months, I had to buy 8 pair, 2 at a time, and exchange 6 of them, to get 2 pair that were less defective than the others. The die is unstable and bleeds or transfers onto everything including my hands when I even touch or handle them; whether wet when laundering or dry when being worn. People at work would asked me, \\\\\"Why are your hands blue?\\\\\" The belt loops were sewn on crooked or askew on several pair. Other pairs would have one leg 1\/2 to an inch shorter or longer than the other. Others would be a different waist or length size than that which was marked on the label or tags. The fabric is much thinner than others I have purchased at retail stores over the last 5 years and stretches out of shape more readily. Even now, 5 months after purchasing them, the die has faded so much that they look worn in the knees and seat. And that is after I soaked them in both vinegar and salt, SEVERAL times, when they were brand new; and always wash them in cold water and hang dry. I don't do hard labor in these jeans, I sit at a desk all day; so they shouldn't wear out this quickly. I will purchase elsewhere next time."}

They did NOT send the wig, which if i wore as a costume would have pissed me off, but i didnt want to wear a wig to my wedding anyways.  I looked amazing and i can even wear it again!"}

Stays on in a breeze, dries fast, breathable, the skirt provides great wrap around protection. Yes you will look like an old lady garden club member\/desert straggler.... But nobodys gonna come tell that to a bunch of burly tattooed men building docks with metal wood and braun. Get this hat you you won't be disappointed. My hat size is 7.5&#34; this fit great."}

Not one full day that it was hooked on my work bag did the strap that goes from the hook to the case itself completely unravel and disintegrate. I purchased this for the sole purpose of clipping it to my bag or belt and it didn't even last 24 hours."}

I'm normally a size 13\\L, but I got an XL because I know my belly gets huge, the L would've fit but I don't know if they would've in a few months.

The brown is a chocolate color and easy to match with a lot of different clothes. The black looks like it shows up well on the chocolate color on the pictures. However, the design on the breast doesn't show up well at all, even in the sun, it blends into the chocolate color of the hoodie and makes it hard to make out. The hoodie itself is pretty light too, not something you wear on a very chilly day."}

You can push them up and down as needed to accommodate swelling or temp change.<br \/><br \/>My one and only complaint is that after 3 days of wear, the fabric developed pills (little tiny balls of fibers) all over both arm warmers. This is not pleasing to the eye and a letdown after such short wear time.<br \/><br \/>Still, compared to others that don't stay up, or are scratchy or tight, these are an excellent buy. Hoping mine were a fluke as I prepare to order more."}
{"label":3,"review":"good quality, looks good on my multicam black hat I purchased!"}
{"label":2,"review":"The jacket is nicely enough made, though I would advise putting parafin on the zippers, rendering them more reliable. The real issue, though is size. The jacket runs very small. If you intend to zip the front zipper, get one size larger than your normal size. If you intend to put anything in the pockets and zip it up, get two sizes larger than normal."}
{"label":3,"review":"This is a wonderful wallet. It is very cool to use and the quality of the product is something to be admired. However, why didn't I give the product 5 stars instead of 4? The ad states it will hold 16 cards. Well, that maybe true, but not if they have credit card embossed stamps on them, which all of mine do, but one. The only card that does not have emboss stamp is the Discover. All of the others have stamp when make the card thicker in the sense of inserting the card into the wallet card slot. So in saying that, the walltet is perfect and will fit 16 cards, but only if they do not have emboss stamped number\/letters. If the cards are flat, you can get 16 in the wallet. But for those of us here in the states, nearly all credit card companies will have embossed stamped numbers. The maximum number of cards that I was able to put into the slots are 11 and 3 into the side pocket. It has a cool money holder, but you'll need to fold the paper money at least twice so that the black clip will hold. I can put 4 $100 bills max in the money holder. There isn't a place to keep pictures, but that's not big deal, because we all have mobile phones these days, so pictures in wallets went out of style a long time ago.<br \/><br \/>Couple of things that I really do like and this is probably the best reason why I like this wallet. 1) The leather is top quality. It has a soft smooth feel. When you touch the leather, you can tell it is high quality grade. 2) The snap that keeps the wallet closed is very easy to use. You do not have to pull it hard to snap it shut. 3) Probably the most important is how the device works when ejecting the card\/s. If you organize your cards by priority, put your most popular card in the back the two cells. With the ejectors at the bottom of your palm, pressing the button will eject the cards in such a way that it will be easy to pull the card out quickly. Be warned, you'll need practice, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be glad you bought it. My wife likes it a lot. She says it is heavy, but I can hardly tell it is in my back pocket.ikes it a lot. She says it is heavy, but I can hardly tell it is in my back pocket."}

{"label":4,"review":"I was very nervous about ordering a bra online because I have a very small frame with very large breasts and finding comfortable, well-fitting bras in a store is difficult enough even when I have the proper sizes to choose from. I did go into a local department store and spoke with an associate trained in measuring for proper size. We determined that I needed a 34 DDD or 34 E, which was not available at all from their line of bras or most everyone else in town. Ordering online was my only option. I usually require an underwire bra (which is not recommended for nursing) just to get enough support, so the fact that an underwire in the correct size was not available further added to my apprehension. I bit the bullet and ordered anyway (1 in nude, 1 in black) because I was desperate for a proper fitting bra. I was pleasantly surprised to find both fit extremely well and are comfortable enough to wear to bed. I will probably order at least one more of each to have for back ups when I return to work."}

{"label":4,"review":"just got these in the mail and the first thing i noticed was how incredibly light they are.  When wearing them it fells like they arent even on.  The length sits right on the knee.

The only problem is that it's still three weeks until Halloween and it barely fits.  My little guy is only 27 lbs and almost 2 1\/2 years old and every time he tries it on, I'm afraid it's going to rip. I also had to cut the seam of the headpiece an inch and a half to get it to fit on his head. I recommend this costume for a thin child who can hardly hold up his 2T pants."}

My only complaint is that it was a little too big for me and I need a smaller size. Otherwise, it's a wonderful dress for the summer and I can't wait to wear it!"}

{"label":1,"review":"To long."}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered a large even though I'm a size 6\/8 (5'7&#34; 140 pounds 32 DD).  It fit beautifully, no bra needed as the bandage wrapping was thick (no panty line) and secure enough to hold the girls through a night of dancing.<br \/><br \/>As for the quality of the workmanship.  There were no frays and the zipper was sturdy enough to withstand the stretching of the material so no micro tears etc after the night was over.<br \/><br \/>I would highly recommend."}
{"label":2,"review":"This item arrived in timely fashion, but did have a tear right along the upper seam, which was an easy fix.  However, I am a normal size 0-2 in stores and this fit really large.  I had to have it taken in before Halloween because it was so large.  Definitely order a size down.  Not a bad costume, and the material is nice."}

They fit well over my bob hair cut, frame my face and head nicely, and keep my upper body warm and toasty in wind, rain, cold.<br \/><br \/>And mostly they make me feel &#34;jaunty&#34; and just put me in a good mood.  They go well with sweaters, dress-up. They sit in the drawer demurely, next to some scarves, just begging for an outing. And I shall give them outings, often!  Nice to have these again after 30 years without them.<br \/><br \/>Buy a lovel crushable foldable bucket church hat in this soft wool felt!  Buy two.. one won't be enough!"}

We've gotten many compliments on it, and my daughter looks super cute in it.  The coat arrived pretty fast  and my daughter has worn it alot this winter.  It doesn't seem as if it would keep her warm enough, but it does!  We've had this coat more than a month now, and its holding up really well. The only thing is, at the back there is a huge cat face with whiskers - the thread on the whiskers run, so you'll want to seal the ends - I just used some fabric glue and that fixed it right up. No problem at all!  I would recommend hand washing this item."}

A quick look on Amazon revealed this PERFECT costume!  She was so excited to get it!  She wore it for all of our Halloween Zoo festival, all of our Halloween carnival, and trick or treating on a chilly night.  Looks great, well constructed, and lots of fun!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Delivered quickly and in excellent condition. Fits well and is comfortable, durable and washes up nicely. Is a good weight -- not too heavy, but heavy enough to keep him warm without getting too hot. He likes it so much we got him a red one to leave at the sitter's house."}

It fits over the girls just fine, but isn't long enough to cover the whole breast (so I have to pull it up every now and again). Still, the price is excellent, and it's better than most anything else I've found."}

{"label":4,"review":"So soft, sexy and comfortable. I am 5' 2&#34;, 125 lbs, 34D and the medium fits perfect with a little room. The small would have worked too but a tad snug. Love the soft feel!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered this top in both red and black. I love them! They are very sexy and very form fitting. I'd read a few reviews before I purchased and I saw that some people said that the shirt is a bit short. I usually wear a size XS\/S, but ordered this in a medium. It fits great and isnt too short since I ordered a size up. So if you don't mind showing a little bit of your stomach, then definitely order in your normal size, but if you want the shirt to be longer, order a size up and you can tighten the laces to make it fit as tight as you'd like. It's a beautiful top, and as always this company has amazing customer service! They really care about the customer and reply to all my emails and are so nice. Highly recommend!"}

{"label":0,"review":"Ordered the 18 inch neck and it came as XXL shirt, which was way too big - returned it as it was too large.  Return was very easy."}
{"label":2,"review":"These jeans have a very low waist and are shorter than most junior's skinny jeans (which are usually way too long for me since I'm only 5'5\\\\\").  But the biggest problem is that they run almost 2 sizes too small. I usually wear a size 9 juniors, sometimes size 11.  I ordered a 9, but I couldn't barely get them over my hips and couldn't button them (about 3 inches left between the buttons)!  I doubt the 11 would even fit. I would have to wear a size 13, which I have never worn in any brand ever!    The size 9 fit my friend who is petite and usually wears size 5 jeans.    SO, if u have wide hips and a rear and\/or are tall, these jeans probably won't fit well.  But, its free to return them so, it can't hurt to try! Just order at least 1 size up."}

The description on the tag is identical to that on the Regular Fit jeans. Both say \\\\\"Sits at Waist\\\\\". Not really. The seat has been changed (I have a 32\\\\\" waist and am not trying to squeeze into too-small jeans) and the rise is different. I understand that companies must innovate to remain competitive. I don't understand why anyone would change an established brand and make it useless to its core customers. If Levis wants to attract new customers it should have made the new fit explicit by giving it a new model number. This change reminds me of the \\\\\"New Coke\\\\\" fiasco. Maybe Lee or Wrangler will do instead."}

{"label":0,"review":"This jacket is not at all as pictured.  I thought it would have a nice sheen to it that made it a little nicer looking than your average trench. It also looks to be a pretty light color in the picture.  In reality, it has a slight olive tint to it that makes it very drab.  There is also no sheen to it.  Additionally, it was huge.  I ordered a small, which is my normal coat size, and it fit like a large."}
{"label":4,"review":"As a full-figured woman, I have a hard time finding a perfect fitting bra.  This bra fits me perfectly and is still pretty enough<br \/>that I don't feel like a matronly grandma when I wear it.  It is well made, silky, it lifts me up, and minimizes my cup size.  Looks great under my tops and dresses and is not cut so high that it shows through scoop necked garments.  I bought 2 more in different colors to complete my basic everyday bra needs."}
{"label":3,"review":"The loops for the handle aren't as sturdy as I wish. I use this wallet every day. After 8 months of use, I expect to need a new one. That's not awful for durability but it could be better. The pocket for keeping cash is too deep to be very handy. The coin\/zippered pouch is awkward to use.<br \/>I purchased this to hold my Samsung Galaxy S3 mobile phone at the same time as my Blackberry. I carry my cash, credit cards, ID and transit passes, too. It certainly does that task. During my search of stores, online and Amazon and purchase of two wallets, this is the only one that held the items that I use daily. I don't carry a purse- it is too tempting to load up and beat down my poor shoulders- so I need a sturdy, multi-tasking, attractive wallet. I will give this one a high-rating and hope that improvements are made or worthy competition (at any price point) comes along."}

The shells after washing have those small little bumps which I did not expect considering the material.

{"label":0,"review":"The manuf boast that this is a bra for full figured women.  I bought several of these bras and spent a great deal of money, and they simply don't work.<br \/><br \/>Straps:<br \/><br \/>They boast that these are comfort staps, but the comfort part is very short and does not extend to the area where most women experience discomfort.  In order to get the comfort straps in place you have to tighten the strap and then the bra is way too high on the rib cage which causes other issues. So you have to choose between shoulder pain or rib pain.<br \/><br \/>Cups:<br \/><br \/>The cups have underwires that do not stay in place after more than 2 washes.  The seamless sides do not support the DD cup and you spill over the top because you have to wear it on the last set of hooks.  The cups do not provide any support for the DD cup size.  It flattens and makes you look older and hanging.<br \/><br \/>The cups are lined, but do not mistake this for light padding that hides the nipple.  You will need a t-shirt bra for that. You can see all of your nipple in this bra.<br \/><br \/>Elastic Sides:<br \/><br \/>The elastic sides gave way and began to stretch out of shape after just a few wears.  The elastic began to poke through the fabric in little white bands.  The fabric looks worn on the sides while the rest of the bra looks brand new.<br \/><br \/>Material:<br \/><br \/>The material does not feel comfortable in the summer.  The side panels are thick and they leave a lumpy impression you can see through your clothing.  I hand washed and line dried these bras because I spent so much money on them.  I bought special laundry detergent for these bras.  I spent over $360 for these bras, chocolate, nude, black, white, & pink.<br \/><br \/>This was a very bad investment because they didn't last 1\/2 the year.<br \/><br \/>I eventually switched to a better bra which is also made by Wacoal 835170."}

It works as a &#34;dress up&#34; wardrobe piece with a skirt and cardigan or jacket, or it works as a more casual look paired with jeans.

{"label":4,"review":"Being the first to express my feelings of this wallet , there is a slight weight on my shoulders being the first to write a product review of an item. As it is , i received my Volkswagen Wallet in the mail fairly quickly and i must say this item was beautifully handcrafted. With genuine leather , i find my self in somewhat in an awkward position when i speak of the beautiful aroma of leather i was greeted with when opening this wallet. With plenty of space and just the right size , i have room for everything i would need a wallet for , plus more. I personally , very much enjoy the extra compartment made specifically for a spare key , as my Volkswagen key fits quite perfect.I received great customer service as i removed all card holder fillers. (which in fact kept my wallet crisp and clean) The solid and precise emblem located on the front of this amazing wallet was even more exciting to look at and an eye catcher at that , this added even more authenticity to this Italian wallet. The emblem is strategically placed and embedded in the leather with great precision.Though the card holder slots may need some breaking in ( by this i only mean overcoming the quality of this wallet and the strength and build to be able to have a looser feel on your cards. After receiving this item , i am very proud to say that i have a strong feeling that at 17 years old and as generations come, my grandson or in fact my great grandson may one day hold his spare key in the pouch a beautifully handcrafted Volkswagen Bi-fold Italian Leather Wallet. - Sincerely , A Satisfied Volkswagen-er.<br \/>Richard E Souza Jr."}
{"label":3,"review":"I ordered this dress for my girlfriend on Sunday and received it on Wednesday, so very fast delivery. The problem is the dress size was too small. We used the sizing chart and it was still too small on my gf. She weighs around 120 lbs, so we though a medium would fit her, but we are exchanging it for a large. She said she could get into it, but it is real tight (around the belly) and she is NOT fat. So beware of ordering it depending on your size?<br \/><br \/>As for the exchange (in progress) I have to pay for the S & H to return it, but they pay for the new S & H to re-ship it. It kind of sucks, as I am basically paying for S&H twice, but it's hard to blame the seller for the sizing? Can't blame us either, it's just one of those chances you take when ordering clothing online.<br \/><br \/>I recommend if you can, to buy from amazon directly, as I am returning a lava lamp (bulb broke) and since it was a amazon product, return S&H is free.<br \/><br \/>I will update this comment depending on how the rest of our experience goes with seller\/size..."}

{"label":4,"review":"Awesome shorts."}
{"label":4,"review":"I really like the fabric used for this cute bikini, sent to me for review.  What makes this style unique and so eye-catching are the two decorative bows.  The one at the front spans half of the bra and the one at the back (slightly smaller) perks up the back view of the briefs, giving them an irresistibly cheeky appeal.<br \/><br \/>I find this bikini perfectly suitable for even young girls because the top is quite demure and the short-style bottom offers quite a bit of coverage.  The top has minimal padding, more of a lining really, and no wire or other support so it is incredibly comfortable to wear and the multiple spaghetti straps distribute pressure very evenly.  The strap that goes over the neck is optional and removable, which is great for sunbathing to minimize tan marks, but don't try to dive in a pool without it!<br \/><br \/>To help you with size selection, in clothes I take a US size 8, and for this I asked for my usual size, Small.  Although the top fits perfectly, I find the bottom a little tight.  It's clearly designed for slim hips, whereas mine are more, shall we say, generous.  So in this case I would advise choosing your size based on the hip measurement, because the top is much more forgiving and customizable.  Or look for a variation on this style with a string bikini bottom.  The fabric is elastic and stretchy, and fully lined.  There is quite a selection of prints and solid colours in various combinations, all very fresh and summery.  A good quality item, well made and nicely finished, and very pretty to look at."}
{"label":3,"review":"I recently bought 5 new pairs of socks, all of them different styles and brands.  For the past few years I've been wearing Thorlos thick cushion running socks which to date are the best socks I've ever worn.  However, they are pricey.  Only a few dollars more than what I paid for these socks, but when buying 10 pairs at a time, a few dollars per pair can make a big difference.<br \/><br \/>I would say that these socks are superior to your average Hanes and Fruit of the Loom socks, but not ton much better.  They breathe, feel quite nice against the skin, and seem very durable.  But I don't think they're worth $10 per pair.  Maybe $5 per pair, $6 maximum.  They lack the cushioning that I desire and are a tad bit too big.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think you're paying for the name on the sock than the sock itself.  If you find them on sale, I recommend these socks, otherwise, I suggest you fork over a few more dollars and go with Thorlos."}
{"label":3,"review":"I really like the concept and the tank looks great. I am normally (pre pregnancy) a 36DD and during pregnancy wore a 38DD. Pre pregnancy shirt size was between a Medium and Large. So I ordered the 38D\/E but it was quite tight and not really big enough in the chest coverage. There was an obscene amount of cleavage, so I can really only wear it in the house or under another shirt. I would recommend going to a larger size for more coverage. But I do like that the band is tight so it gives better support. If I were to order again I'd go up a size."}

Material is a mid thickness and a nice dark green. Would be perfect if it was looser for an xl and not made with wool. It is itchy due to the wool mix. The length is nice hitting around my mid thigh\/towards knee.<br \/><br \/>I gave it 3 stars based on sizing not based on the the wool mix."}

However, the color is darker than I expected,it still looked great on. The fit is very comfortable in the chest\/arm area and size is true to fit with extra room. My only complaint is that the sweater feels short and boxy, this is not a purchase for a tall guy. Also, I didn't like that there were loose threads hanging off the product but overall great product for the price."}

I have skinny hands but very long fingers so I ordered a large.

{"label":3,"review":"So far, so good.<br \/>I just received my waist cincher yesterday and after reading previous reviews I expected a tight fit. I ordered my size according to the sizing chart and it took me lying down on my back and having my husband and his big strong arms to fasten all of the clamps to get it on. But once I got in it, I didn't want to take it off. It instantly took inches off of my waist and gave me the hourglass figure I'm hoping to have without any cinching garment. It will take some getting used to since it is really tight, but I can move around in it just fine. I worked out in it this morning after rubbing my stomach with some Albolene and wrapping with plastic and I sweated like crazy. I want to where the cincher all day to start the waist training process but that seems kind of gross after sweating so much in it. I will be buying another waist cincher in the near future. 1 to wear while working out and the other to wear during the day. I also plan to buy another, one size smaller just to continue the cinching process after I've lost a little weight. This is my new favorite thing. SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW, I LOOK AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered these snow pants because the price was so low. These pants far exceeded my expectations. The quality is excellent. Altho the insulation is thin it definitely does the job. Front pockets have zippers. The bottom of the pants have zippers to wear them over boots (I wear mine inside my boots.) The waist adjustments on each side are velcro. I take a medium - ordered medium and they fit perfectly. They are easy to jump in or pull off.  The shell cuts off any wind and are waterproof. And certainly WARM! (I wear long johns beneath.)  I can't report on the durability of the zippers - so far they have held up - and that would be the only possible weakness I could see to these pants. If I get a full season out of them (and my winters are long and the snow heavy) I'll consider it a real bargain indeed.  BTW - there's a white Arctix logo is sewn on the mid leg and another down near the calf area.  I am very pleased I took the chance ordering these because they were the most inexpensive I found after endless searching!"}

However, my son just told me that as he started wearing the underwear, three pairs from the first pack of six had holes in the seams before he even put the briefs on.  He has not opened the second six pack so I do not know what he will find in that package.  I am really surprised at Jockey.  My daughter and I have been wearing Jockeys for years and years and have never had a problem.  This is poor quality control and I am really disappointed."}

{"label":4,"review":"I was so ecstatic when I bought a pair of these and found that someone finally makes a no show sock that won't show with most modern dress shoes. It's true, they really are secret. The grip on the heel keeps them in place. I haven't had any slip off my heel like others I've used in the past. Some people mentioned that the cream colored ones are more prone to holes, but I've been wearing them for a month and haven't noticed any holes or wear around the little hems. If any holes appear in the near future I'll give an update. They are kind of expensive to me but worth it for the quality. I highly recommend them!"}
{"label":2,"review":"The whole reason I bought this was because I wear scrubs at work and I have a large back tattoo I wanted covered when I was bending over\/down. Nowhere on this page was it mentioned that there is a hole in the back of this. For my purposes it was a complete waste of my money as I can't use it for work. Though I do think that is faulty advertising (should have been written somewhere, or show a picture of the back) it doesn't mean this won't work for other people\/reasons."}

In the ten minutes I've worn it, I've gotten four compliments and a plea from a friend to order one for her too. It is incredibly soft and comfortable. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it does not have pockets and the weave is a little loose in places. Nevertheless, this is perfect for what I needed and quite chic."}

Although not all Levi's fit the same even if they are the same size not sure what makes the difference but sometimes you have to buy the size you wear and take the chance.

Great rear coverage, unless you pull it up to high, covers well, soft material, and tie straps on top holds everything in.  Will not recommend outdoors unless using as a cover up over your bathing suit.  Otherwise the thin material will show the goods.  Will purchase from this seller again in other colors if priced low again."}

There is no ribbon under the chest, the bow is limpy, and the triangles of satin covering the chest are lined by vey visible zigzags of black elastic stitching.

After about a month of use there were white patches where the paint chipped away, and taking the cover off at all caused the plastic to snap. I ended up using this for only two months and replacing it.<br \/><br \/>Great idea, poorly executed. I suppose it's worth it if you baby your phone."}

{"label":2,"review":"After a previous order of the same bra in another color turned out to be a positive experience -- a great bra, exactly as described, delivered quickly -- I ordered two more in (of course) the exact same size, in two other colors. When they arrived, I saw that they had the same Wacoal tag, and I checked the size on the inside labels. Both bras had the correct size in the label. I put them away in a drawer.<br \/><br \/>Two weeks ago I tried one on and was shocked to find that the side bands didn't reach the middle of my back so I couldn't hook the bra in the back. I then put both new bras next to the Wacoal bra I'd been wearing (for about two months) and found that each side band of the new bras was a full one inch shorter, or a total of two inches shorter.<br \/><br \/>I assume that these bras are \\\\\"seconds\\\\\" owing to some flaw, in my case, the label size is incorrect. Instead of a 36DDD, as labeled, my bras are really probably a size 32DDD. I can't face trying to return them, so I'm hoping they will somehow stretch out. ???"}

{"label":1,"review":"The color of these pants is super fun. However, the fit is so stretchy that they have to be pulled up many times during a workout. They are more for a light workout, such as working on machine, rather than a harder workout such as a bootcamo. Overall, I love the color and style! They are just limiting as to when they can be worn."}

{"label":3,"review":"Material - Cotton. Nice weight. I really like how it feels after you wash it. The quality and weave is very soft and smooth on skin. Beware of EXTREME shrinkage. When I first bought this and other Spasilk footed pj's, I was upset because it looked like 3-6m when I ordered 0-3m. I stuck it in a drawer thinking I'll pull them out when baby is 3 or 4 months. But the weather got suddenly colder, I decided to use them anyway and took them out when baby was 1.5 months. After washing and drying, they shrunk so much, that they fit perfectly (length-wise).<br \/><br \/>Design - I bought this and other Spasilk footed pj's because I was looking for clothing with the fold over mitten cuffs. These have it  and it helps keep baby hands warm and the baby's face and eyes from being scratched. I noticed that the fit was wide and roomy even though the length was perfect or almost a little short (after wash and shrink). At first the baggy look bothered me but then I liked it because the wider fit made it easy to  dress the baby. Less tugging to get the garment on -- If you put the legs in first. One thing I didn't like is the single button leg. Its fine if you're dressing your baby and put the legs in first or if the garment is runs big on your baby. But once your baby starts to fill it in, then it is more difficult to get legs in and out for diaper changes. I don't like tugging and bending the baby's legs too much. And because this is a one piece, when you tug a the legs, you put pressure on the arms and shoulders, too. Sometimes the tugging makes my baby cry and I definitely don't like that.<br \/><br \/>3 stars because I really wished the buttons went down both legs. I mean you're changing 8-10 diapers a day, for a 0-3 month old. If something is slightly less convenient, the frequency really magnifies the problem. 5 stars for quality materials (however not organic though for those who care). 4 stars overall. They are quite nice. I'v bought the 6M and 9M as my baby grew. Quite a nice staple footie.<br \/><br \/>NOTE: Only the 3M has mitten cuffs. 6M and 9M don't.aple footie.<br \/><br \/>NOTE: Only the 3M has mitten cuffs. 6M and 9M don't."}

I have a bust size of 36D and I wear size 8-10 (9 specifically), I'm 5'2&#34;, 128lbs and I ordered the Large size. It fits perfectly! It supports my chest well and it fits like a glove. I cannot wait to wear it out. I've been wearing it around the house and it is comfy and slides up only slightly, which is good because it'll be shorter than the dress I am wearing over it. Love the product and love the price that I paid for it."}

I am a size XL, and the top makes me look like a size XXL, but I had also expected that due to the cut. I needed something very lightweight for traveling to tropical climates. It's perfect for that. I could only give 3 stars because the top requires so much care. (Thank you to others before me who posted their thoughts. When I am unsure about purchases, I always read reviews!)"}

A nude bra and you can't see through the white one (which happens rarely ever for me).<br \/>Can't see any bra lines.<br \/>Not spandex looking & actually looks like a cotton tee that just happens to fit perfectly, be stretchy, & not stretch out.<br \/><br \/>These were exactly what I needed to put under a few jumpsuits I have that I wanted to make more modest & give them some sleeves without adding bulk in the midsection. They are so comfy though I can even wear them to work out in. I'm planning on buying every color!<br \/><br \/>Tiny downfall: the black seems to attract a bit more lint than I'd love but that's barely even worth mentioning due to all the great things."}
{"label":1,"review":"This is a handsome belt, I would give it 5 stars if the belt could stay in the condition it was in at purchase. Unfortunately the finish on the belt is trash. It can be scratched with a fingernail, or nearly anything that touches it, so now after a few months of use it looks like a scratching post. The belt holds pants up though so I guess it's worth a star or two."}

I wish more of the Freya prints had a &#34;hipster&#34; bottom to match.  If I can get over the 1\/4 inch difference I will keep it.

This is my first experience with alpaca wool and after I've had them on for a while they start feeling a little bit itchy on my wrists\/arms but it's not too bad.

As everyone knows, when you try to even things (hair cuts, skirts, cake servings, carpentry projects)  out, you either end up with nothing left or an architectural miracle.<br \/><br \/>They're great products, they are what they say they are and appear to be good quality.....But for my purposes, using one would start an escalation that would end up with me resembling a front-end loader and incapable of bending over without losing some vital support for the effect.<br \/><br \/>I wish they made kits where you could use a syringe and fill the insert to the desired volume. And, no, I'm not going to resort to water balloons.<br \/><br \/>I might rethink that position later in the summer. Keep my bras in the refrigerator?"}

I started with an extra large because it looked small.  I returned that one and got an 2xlarge which is still tight on my 42 jacket size frame.

Unlike the lace \\\\\"zen floral\\\\\"(which I also love) this can be worn in situations where you want a more professional \\\\\"cami\\\\\" peeking out of that too-low top.  It doesn't give a uni-breast either, so I have worn it under a black sweater that needed the smoothness.  It was also less expensive than many other Natori bras.  Great purchase."}
{"label":2,"review":"I received this top the first day it was estimated to arrive.  The picture makes the fabric look cheap, but it's not.  It's cotton and spandex.  The front closes with small buttons that a metal piece hooks around.  The hooks easily pop open.  This might be avoided if you order in the correct size. I ordered this in a medium and this is extremely tight.  I am 5'10, 160lbs and have a small top with larger hips and normally wear a small to medium on my top.  I would suggest to order the next size up because this company does not exchange or let you return. There is an attached privacy panel.  It also comes with a g-string thong."}

They don't bunch at your knees or groin and are stretchy enough that there are no awkward wrinkles."}

I've washed these several times already and they seem to be holding their fit well although the waist band gets a little wrinkled after washing but most of the time it can be ironed straight again. Just be sure to wash with cold water and dry on low and they should retain their fit for plenty time to come."}

{"label":4,"review":"I am very happy with this item.  I've been wearing it every day for three days now, and I feel that my posture is a lot better, and I feel more energetic.  The girdle has a very well-made elastic band that supports my uterus, so it helps me hold my expanding tummy better.  The panty style is good for me, too, since I like to keep my stomach warm.  (It is expandable, so I expect to wear it until I have the baby.)  Ever since I found out that I was pregnant, I had been looking for the perfect maternity girdle.  There seem to be a few out there, but this one looked the best.  Although the price is steep, it's made in Austria, and definitely is comfortable to wear.  It's a good investment, even for only a few months.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants some back support and stomach coverage."}
{"label":2,"review":"Given the price and manufacturer I expected better quality, but after less then one week they are starting to slightly fray on the fingertips.  In retrospect I could have bought cheaper gloves and it probably would have been fine."}

{"label":4,"review":"I love these wrap around skirts. First of all, there is not a lot of material around the waist area, so the skirt gives you a slender profile. Second, it is easy to wear, long enough to be modest, yet still elegant and interesting."}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought this for my daughter of 43 years. I called her and she said she was wearing it at that moment, and she liked it. Her husband said it looked nice on her. Couldn't give 5 stars because I haven't seen it in person."}
{"label":2,"review":"I really like how these look with leggings and boots but I should have just paid the extra $$ for cuffs that had more positive reviews. I had read other reviews about these coming with different size lace or one being tighter than the other. I decided to take a chance, because they were cheaper than other brands and I figured I wouldn't be out a ton of money if I got a bad pair.<br \/>One of the cuffs is slightly smaller in width than the other one. The first time I wore them, it was so tight I could get it up to just the height of my boot but pulling it higher to where it is supposed to be, made me feel like my leg was being strangled. I stretched it to pull out the ribbing on the top. Thankfully it didn't pull the yarn completely apart so you can't tell that it was stretched and it still looks fine. I gave 3 stars because I was able to make it work, but I won't be buying from this compmany again because I shouldn't have had to do that."}

{"label":3,"review":"These jeans fit great! They are higher than low-riders so they don't leave you exposed, but not so high that they would seem like \\\\\"mom jeans\\\\\". The fabric is soft, not stiff...they feel like they've been stone washed. The amazing fit is attributed to the extra tummy control which smooths like control top hose without any discomfort. I highly recommend these jeans!"}

{"label":3,"review":"Is cool"}
{"label":2,"review":"First off, it worked as expected and does it's job under my white linen pants. The color ivory is more appropriate to match skin color as it is more disguised than if it was white. The fit though - that's a different story. They run large in the waist ONLY (from the crotch and up), true to size (in hip area only) and small (from knees and down) - size chart said I should get a medium but I bought a Small...thank God! I'm 5'6, 138 lbs - I normally wear size 6 or 7\/8 in pants and small\/medium in shirts. The bottom of these pant liners is about an inch above my ankle....they fit more like a capri style length. The waist band of these are VERY high waisted and large. So if you are wearing regular pants that fall at the waist line then you must wear a long non see-through shirt that covers up the waist because this liner goes about 3 inches ABOVE the pants. Which is fine because I'm not walking around in cut off shirts. The length is even fine with me. However, the problem is they slide down because the ankle part (where the lace begins) is tight and if you try to pull up the pant liners to match the crotch with your crotch...you can't because it's so tight around the ankle\/calf that it prevents you from pulling up the pants any higher. Even if you had them altered to be lower waisted, the ankle\/calf part is still tight and it will leave the crotch hanging a couple inches below your normal crotch. All in All....they work and I can wear them with my pants. The pant liner is a see-thru fabric just like any regular slip would be. It's more of a SLIP...not a LINER. If you expecting a spanx material then this isn't for you! I would recommend this product because I have a feeling all pant slips would fit the same around the waist."}
{"label":4,"review":"My baby brother loves them! Very great product."}

{"label":3,"review":"These cufflinks may be rhinestone, but they have a high quality look and function great."}
{"label":2,"review":"I had to add a bit of elastic to the shorts in the back.  The quality is fine.  I just wish the shorts came with the ability to adjust the waist.  This is so important for little kids, hence the 3 stars.  This is my only complaint.  Shirt is soft."}
{"label":2,"review":"I absolutely love the material and design. The only problem is that it is way too small. Its more of a kids than an adults size. Sad I have to return and pay now for shipping to try and get another but I love the quality but the size is wayyy too small"}

I seriously want my money back"}
{"label":2,"review":"It is okay."}
{"label":4,"review":"Okay, it's not gorgeous or delicate or sexy.  But more importantly, for the quality of support it's the most comfortable bra I've ever put on.  Visually, the no-wire construction definitely creates a different - but more natural - shape for me.  The wide sides are much smoother than what I'm used to.  Halfway through my day, wearing one of my old ones I would already be feeling a little pinched, but with this it's easy to forget I'm even wearing a bra.  I'd call this a great value."}

This comfortable, stretchy, and cool-looking blazer meets all my strict criteria.  Just to let you know, the buttons are really big!  But it all works.

{"label":3,"review":"The fabric is soft and the flower is made from chiffon (rather than being one of those stiff scratchy fake flowers often glued on children's clothing). On the downside, there are semi-sheer polka-dots and the dress is unlined. No bloomers either. Indeed, none of the Sweet Heart Rose girls dresses seem to have bloomers. I have purchase infant dresses that had bloomers from this company. We will use leggings underneath. All in all, a pretty dress."}
{"label":4,"review":"Really great quality for an amazing price!!"}
{"label":2,"review":"This shirt took an uncommonly long time to ship and when it arrived it was larger than the average &#34;medium&#34; size. However, the material is fairly sturdy and the design is as fun as it appears in the photo. It's not really a &#34;fitted&#34; men's tee, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll think it's baggy."}
{"label":3,"review":"This is a great solid costume! The detail is amazing. The chest and torso have astonishing detail. The chest has a real texture printed onto it, the star pops out nicely as well. The straps on the torso are also very real, they are the kind of the straps you would find on a backpack. Very screen accurate. The belt is pretty nice as well, it has working pockets, but I wouldn't suggest putting much in them, as the belt is held together by small Velcro patches. The arms have the details and textures printed directly on the fabric its self, no texture, unlike the chest, but I recommend buying the gloves for the costume as well, they add some some nice real detail and cover up the sleeves that have gloves printed on them. Overall the costume fit me perfectly, I ordered an extra large and I'm 185 pounds and 5'11, and it was very comfortable.  It was a little tight on my back shoulders, and chest, but that might be because I'm a swimmer. Zipping it up is a little bit of challenge, but I managed to zip it up myself with some flexing. The bottom portion of the costume is pretty decent as well, and the designers did a great job with incorporating boot covers. The weakest point of the costume is the mask. You're going to look pretty goofy if you have bangs, because they will poke out though the mask's eye holes. This is the same mask that is included in the cheaper version of the costume, but I don't plan on wearing the mask anyway for Halloween. I brought a metal army helmet and painted it blue with white details, it looks much better than a mask. Overall great costume, feel free to wash it in cold water with detergent and softner, its not going to shink unless you dry it. And don't forget your shield."}

Keeps you warm, and I tested it in -30 C, so it works pretty good (I ordered the dark grey - thick).  I am 5'9&#34; and regular build, so I followed the sizing chart and ordered the US size medium, which corresponds to an unusual size according to the Asian size chart."}

I am 5'6'', 125 lbs, with a 34B chest and a flat-ish behind.  The top portion completely covered my chest area, and it was hard to achieve the look of cleavage as it isn't padded or shaped in any way, it's just a lace top.  Together with the bottom, though, it is a pretty flattering set and it seems to be well manufactured.  I am pleased with the purchase and will be keeping it."}

{"label":3,"review":"Passes the knee with no slits yesss... modesty still lives. I bought a size up on purpose. I didnt want any squeezed look. The waist was a little loose but the hips were good at a size up. A hipsy person may want to do the same. I took away a star to alert folks to carefully think about size. Stiil a good buy.<br \/>It washed well, stayed jet black, does not look low budget while in use especially if used with a jacket. I am pleased with this purchase."}

{"label":1,"review":"I have been wearing Nippies (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Nippies-Skin-Reusable-Silicone-ADHESIVE\/dp\/B001PU9A9Q) for several months and really like them, but decided to try these because they're less expensive and were recommended by a Nippies reviewer.  I really wanted to love them, but they just don't work well for me!    These Spicy Spot nipple covers are a lot thicker than Nippies, but much more transparent: if I wear a light-colored shirt with the Spicy Spot covers, you can see my nipples clear as day (compared with not at all when I wear Nippies).  Also, their thickness causes them not to adhere very well; I kept having to press them back on during the day, which must have appeared as though I was feeling myself up in public -- how embarrassing!  They also have this flower shape which is clearly visible under form-fitting shirts.    I wish I'd liked these more, but I will be staying a Nippies customer!  The Nippies brand has provided me with much better coverage and staying power, and it's worth the extra money to me."}

It handles wind really well, and it's very light. Easy to move around.<br \/><br \/>The two minor annoyances I have:<br \/>1. The hood can easily slip off unless you zip up all the way<br \/>2. It's a tiny bit too long past the waist. I have to scrunch it up a little after sitting down so it doesn't get caught under me.<br \/><br \/>Overall, excellent purchase"}

One is a size 2 - the costume fit her fine.  One is a size 8 - costume was snug, but wearable with a white tank as there was a gap between the top and the low rise pants.  One is a size 8 with a full bottom - the top fit fine, but the pants didn't even cover her bottom.  I had to return all three because we have to match...  Bummer, because it's really cute and would look great on stage."}

The star, brass, and hammer\/sickle shine brilliantly in the black, the ear flags are very comfortable too, the hat is nice and warm, but not too much if left tied in the up position when indoors.

Exceptional quality too, everything is tightly sewn and the quilted interior is patterned perfectly. I adore how this matches my black oilskin overcoat, and that it comes with a soviet star that matches the soviet badges on my coat.<br \/><br \/>So if you wanna be warm and look cool this winter, this is the hat for you~ ^_^<br \/><br \/>Plus, its made in Moscow, Russia!

{"label":4,"review":"I'm rating the jacket before I actually have a chance to wear it.  Its a very nice looking jacket, substantial, yet lightweight material, with a nice, soft feel to it.  It has 2 zip-out linings, one quilted and one waterproof.  There are 4 pockets which either zip or velcro closed, although strangely enough there are three on the left side and only one on the right.  It has a zippered tab in the center back for attaching riding pants.  There are 3 adjustments for snugging in the arm areas, as well as waist adjustments.  There are removeable pads for the back, shoulders, and elbows (although the shoulder pads are an iffy fit if your shoulders aren't just the right width).      My only \\\\\"complaint\\\\\" is that the description clearly states that you can open the vents to cool down, and I have not been able to locate any vents.  Hopefully they are just well hidden and I will find them.     Overall it seems to be a very well made article - we'll see how well it holds up to the wear and tear of motorcycling."}

{"label":1,"review":"First of all....the other day i was in the popular chainstore THE DOLLAR TREE (where everything in the store costs $1.00) and low and behold what did i see? the JUST LOVE bras pictured on this listing...for $1.00 each!!! These are truly Dollar store bras....and they are WAY over priced here ...considering you can get them for only $1.00 each at THE DOLLAR TREE.    You basically are buying Disposable bras. They lose their shape after being worn all day and the stitching comes undone very easily. They are just sooooo incredibly cheaply made its pathetic. Not good support bras AT ALL.    The first thing I noticed is that the only colored bras I got in this package were 1 blue, 2 orange, 1 red, 1 pink, and the other 10 were either black, white or nude. I was hoping to AT LEAST get one or two lavender colored bras as well. The second thing I noticed is that the straps seem really really cheap....like if you wash them they might break or fall off....I haven't washed them yet so I don't know. I can tell you that the advice to go up a size is advice that you should follow. I typically wear a 34B so I ordered a 34C in these bras and they fit perfectly. I suggest anyone who orders these to do the same. My personal advice though....Don't waste your money on these bras. True, you get 15...but they won't stand the test of time like a good Victorias Secret bra will. I suggest searching EBAY for Victorias Secret bra lots instead of buying this cheap Dollar Store brand...Just Love...what the heck is that anyway? I had never even heard of this brand before and I will not make the mistake of ordering cheap bras again."}

{"label":4,"review":"I bought 2 of these in the yellow color & the mauve color. I love both as they are great basic scarves. The mauve color is exquisite in my opinion & the yellow completely brightens your whole outfit (in a good way). Both colors look just like the pictures shown. The material is thick enough to hang kinda loosely from your neck while keeping you warm, but not too thick to wear just for fashion; I'd say it's more on the thin side. Either way I would recommend these scarves for sure."}
{"label":3,"review":"This is my first ever pair of jeggings and I'm so happy with the fit and comfort.  I ordered the size 16 and they're just a little big in the waist and shorter than most pants but since I wear them with boots, it's not a big deal. I'm 5'10&#34; so pants being short is just a part of life.<br \/><br \/>I'd have given them 5 stars (or more if possible) if I could get rid of the smell.  I expect clothing that has been shipped to have an odor but after washing (according to instructions) they still have a lingering smell.  Almost like finger nail polish.  The smell keeps me from being able to wear them for a full day, bummer since I'd planned to wear them to school."}
{"label":2,"review":"I ordered these for my son because he wears a 34x36 and it is a hard size to find, but these actually ran rather long, which we don't ever seem to have that problem. So we ordered him a 34x34 and it was a much better fit."}
{"label":4,"review":"OK, so one pair did get a teeny tiny hole in the crotch almost immediately. And I read the other reviews so I've been hanging them all to dry. That being said, the tiny hole was an easy fix. $12 for SUPER COMFY lounge\/yoga pants, I'm sold! I'm 5'8&#34; and they are a tad long but I don't mind. If I did, my tailoring lady only charges $2.99 for hemming so it'd be an easy fix if I wanted it. All in all, worth trying for the price!"}
{"label":0,"review":"Not sure what else to say but I swear these were made out of glad bags or something.  The look nice, and fit perfectly.  They wee very inexpensive, but still.  I wore them on a cruise for about two hours at the pool.  Then I went to the store paid way to much for a better one in the gift shop and I threw them away.  I loved the style, fit etc.  But the material is gross."}

{"label":0,"review":"Wow! That is what I said when I got this. I got the large size and was shocked at the craftmanship. Detailing is great, the style not so much. They took a small belt and added an extension to both sides. This would have been fine but the loops they used are larger than your standard belt loops. It took about 5 min to wiggle the belt on. Then came the best part. I wear a size 8 pants. The last extension began on the last belt loop. Couldn't even use the belt at that point.<br \/>Returned immediately."}
{"label":4,"review":"I love this shirt. The material is soft, heavy and slinky so it swings and drapes. It is very flattering. My ONLY issue is the neckline. It's shaped in such a way that my bra straps show in both the bottom corners of the neckline. I have a large bust size, it may be the type of bras that I have to wear (full support with the thick straps.) A smaller, thin-strapped bra might not have the same problem. Or a strapless."}
{"label":4,"review":"I LOVE Stan Herman nightwear.  His items are always so soft and plush.  The only complaint I have with his products<br \/>( not THIS one, though ) is when something has a zipper.  Those plastic zippers do not work well.  So, that is the reason I ordered this robe with a TIE instead of zipper.  I feel like a Queen when I have it on !  The length is perfect........not too long where I may trip on it."}
{"label":4,"review":"I like my green wallet. It has convenient small size for me, nice quality and looks stylish (especially green color). It should be noted that in real the wallet looks much better than in the photo.<br \/>I also like that the wallet has one compartment for cash. When I used my old wallet I had to think about choosing the compartment for money every time :-). I cant understand why the major amount of wallets has two compartments.<br \/>In wallet I put the driver license, 4 credit cards and some cash. If you have more cards I think this wallet will not be a good choice for you."}

It's too small to even see out of and it is VERY scratchy material that surrounds the face."}
{"label":0,"review":"As a male PhD, who hates sweating through outdoor commencement ceremonies I was excited that this might be a great regalia option. Unfortunately even the largest size was too snug for this professor to get it zipped. Further, I guess you were thinking the PhDs who may order this regalia wouldn't miss the velvet chevrons, tam, and hood that actually distinguish the PhD from other regalia. Guilty! I didn't even notice as I was so excited to have such a warm weather friendly option. As an additional note, I have been unable to find those very comfortable looking shoes from the picture in a size 14. I guess I'll have to save my &#34;Darling Sexy&#34; look for another time."}

{"label":0,"review":"I wish there was a way to rate this with no stars. Unlike other reviews my umbrellas arrived dirty, defective and hardly worth the $32 per piece price tag! Since these are being used in shower centerpieces I plan to keep them if exchanges, for those that were too dirty or broken to keep, work out. They do not auto open or close and will pinch on closing. Every tip is scratched so I either have to paint them or leave them as is. They have black ribbing (not white) and black stems; NOT told in the description. They came wrapped in dirty plastic sleeves and only 2 of the acrylic handles had plastic on them. Every handle is scratched and the acrylic is full of bubbles or blobs of extra acrylic inside. Every umbrella had another label at some point on the main stem that's been removed leaving a sticky mess behind. They suit my needs as a craft item but are at best worth .32 cents a piece--not the hefty $32 a piece I paid for a grand total of $320! They are made in China and are truly junk. Save your money if you are looking for a functional umbrella. These should be sold for decoration only and at a fraction of the price that Greatlookz has the audacity to sell them for! I'll write more when the replacements arrive. The lot of them may well be going back.<br \/><br \/>Updated 7\/22\/13--I did in fact keep all 10 of these. They were a hit at the baby shower but my suggestion for anyone who wants a craft umbrella is to rent them. I could not (dates sold out) and was forced to go this route since I wanted the pagoda style. But if you are looking for an umbrella to keep you dry--do NOT waste your money. Go with a department store umbrella for a fraction of the price. These are truly junk."}

When I received the item, the mask only covered the eyes.  I know my grandson will be disappointed.  I am not sure what to do.  Do I have any recourse without it costing me return and shipping charges?  I was very satisfied with the quality of the product, but it was not what I expected."}

Other high end products generally just accept returns or exchanges and don't ask the customer to jump through hoops.  I bought several pairs of these underwear and will not purchase them again and will not recommend them to anyone.  For underwear that costs $30\/pair, they are not worth the money."}

So i gave these a try ,they just happen to be so comfortable - they stretch as you bend - keep their nice neat appearance all thru ur work day. No sagging and stretching out as the day goes. They always wash well , mine did not shrink in the dryer...nor did they have any lint stuck to them.<br \/>Great for office or dress ocasions. I am tall but these pants were not too short for me , the women's size is usually an inch or so shorter than i would like...but not these.If you have a big stomach area they make u look great...slimming with out the giant pant legs , just because u have a big middle.CAN NOT FIND THIS PANT WITH POCKETS. THESE HAVE NONE & ALSO THE COLOR CHOICES ARE NOT REALISTIC FOR THE WORKING WOMAN'S WARDROBE........Too bad....nice product....would buy several pairs if they had the right colors: chocolate brown - charcoals - dark denim - dark tans - white - burgundy - maybe even a pumpkin spice color......all those pastels are pretty but not everyone wants to shine that bright...LOL"}

{"label":3,"review":"Good quality pair of pants and good looking.  The markings on the side are just right because I'm the type that does not like the colorings on the side to appear too big.  The side colorings are just right in size.  The pants were a tad too small, so I will have to lose about one inch, which is about 8 lbs for me.  So you might want to order them one size bigger--unless you lose 8 lbs like I said.  In a way, I like that because that way the pants are not extra baggy--you know what I mean when us guys order x-large and the pants come in looking baggy or like a parachute that fluffs out in a gust of wind.  Because of this they look more form fitting."}

Fred Perry is quality clothing and for $19.99 this is a steal!

Several men even threaten to steal this coat whenever I hung it up...LOL I bought this coat because it was medium weight and it was 3\/4 coat length. It looks great with dress clothes or casual clothes.  I'm an athletic built men, 5'11\\\\\" 185 lbs. and the LARGE size fits me like it was tailored for me. The only issue that I had was that one button was coming loose with only 2 wks of use.  I took it to my tailor and had a fixed as I waited...No cost or problem.  This coat is a great value made by a great name, Kenneth Cole."}

{"label":3,"review":"As a cotton blend the fabric should wear well and not shrink or lose shape like the 100% cotton shirts. However, this trade off makes the shirt not so soft or comfortable. Fabric while lighter weight than all cotton should wear well as blends normally do. Stitching is fine no overt defects. Overall I'm happy."}

I wanted something close to my skin color and I have quite fair skin.  I like the lace and the silicone seems to be adequate to keep them up.  They are quite snug but rather have them a little too snug than too loose.  They didn't quite come up as high as it shows in the picture, but I'm on the tall side of the size I purchased.

I ordered dark brown, but the color I received was much lighter than expected or pictured, like a light copper. Also, there was a bit of a smell to it and the &#34;scalp&#34; of the wig can be seen depending on the way the bangs are situated. Nit picky, I know, but small things like this matter when you wear wigs outside of the house. This wig is very nice for the price, it's soft, doesn't overly shed like some synthetic wigs. I'll definitely be more careful if I order again. Edit: Wearing for the first time and &#34;scalp&#34; of the wig keeps showing no matter how the bags sit. I'm giving it away to someone else."}

The dresses did come in bags, and are wrinkled, but I mean what are the other options? A few people complained about the zipper and while it was a little difficult it didn't change my mind, or how beautiful they looked when trying them on.

He said it was comfortable than most wallets and he could just slide it into his back pants pocket and be fine. It does hold a lot and it seems to with stand pretty much everything. Because it is made out of some type of recycled material, it gets pretty worn in easily. It does not stay the way it originally looks for long, but it still keeps the design.

{"label":3,"review":"Adorable little shirt for my Paw Patrol-loving four-year-old.  Print has held up well after several washes.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the material is a little thin...especially for a long-sleeved shirt.  Overall, I'm very pleased!"}
{"label":1,"review":"I bought it for my mom and it was too thin. She wonders if it really is cashmere as it does not seem to make much of a difference in keeping out some of the cold."}

{"label":4,"review":"I was uncertain of what to expect from this wig.  It looks\/feels like real hair (I didn't check to see if it was real hair...), it's long and luxurious, and it is going to take my daughter's halloween costume to the next level.  I am very, very happy with this purchase!"}
{"label":2,"review":"Since it's no longer the 1970s, it's just a little weird to have 100% polyester men's trousers, but they look nice enough with a polo or casual button-down shirt.  I don't think that anyone would complain about the appearance, and some people might like the smoother feel of the fabric.<br \/><br \/>But the big complaint is static cling that starts moments after leaving the house.  The washing directions are machine wash warm, tumble dry low (they also drip dry quickly), and no smelly dryer sheets.  I don't know how to solve this:  if you're not supposed to use anti-static dryer sheets or other chemicals (which, like a lot of people, I hate anyway), and if you're getting static cling problems despite drip-drying (and no wool or other problematic fibers in sight), then how do you make these wearable?<br \/><br \/>I don't think we'll buy these again."}
{"label":4,"review":"I typically wear a size 13 4E shoe and these fit me just fine. There are of high quality (very soft with just a little bit of a cushion) and fairly priced for the quantity. I would definitely buy them again."}

{"label":4,"review":"I purchased the black caftan and love it.  I use it to cover my swimsuit while not in the pool. It is light weight, not the best quality construction but for $12 I wasn't expecting Michael Kors. I wash it on handwash, cold, gentle spin, and hang dry. Very few wrinkles and held together which is more than I can say about some other clothing I have purchased.<br \/>All in all, satisfied with it."}
{"label":4,"review":"Excelent"}

{"label":3,"review":"The top is great and gives lots of support; I would have paid the full price just for it... so i'm not too irritated that the bottoms are tiny. I ordered a large based on other reviews of the product and they're still really small. I'm a US size 6 (juniors 7), so I figured large would be fine... but no, they're like a US 2."}
{"label":4,"review":"absolutely love this shirt!! the fabric is thin stretchy and soft. It looks very flattering on. You can zip your face up too because the zipper goes all the way up !! Also, the package came in the mail the next day. Awesome shipping. definitely buying more from them !"}
{"label":2,"review":"These socks seem to run somewhat small for their described size. My feet are toward the larger end of the range, and while the socks technically fit, the material is stretched thin to where you can see my foot through the sock. Notice in the picture how you can kind of see the manikin's foot through the upper part of the sock? It is so much worse in real life. My toes also get a little squished, which anyone can tell you isn't good. I probably wont buy these again when there are better options available for much less."}
{"label":4,"review":"Been wearing these for forty years and many stores telling me they weren't being made any more.  They ar e the best."}

{"label":4,"review":"my daughter is a 12, but I purchased a 14.  It came down to her knees (she is about 4 feet tall)  and the sleeves just needed to be folded once.  I would recommend going the extra size up as the coat is lovely and kids can grow into it, thus longer use.  We went to NY and my daughter did not need an extra sweater underneath and never complained about being cold.  The coat, aside from being beautiful on the outside, did its job!! It is lined with fur on the inside and it kept warm.  I wish there were adult sizes!!"}
{"label":3,"review":"It took forever to get! Ordered Dec. 2, 2013, didn't get it until Dec.24,2013. I don't like the material,  but I can live with it. I would definitely order again, if need be. Hoping the material holds up as I've only wore it for 1 day."}
{"label":3,"review":"It was very similar to a well worn robe my father liked that wa worn out.  He's even using it!"}

Normally I am between uk size 10 and 12. I am unhappy because I can't make use of something I bought that expensive. I have already checked the lowest size and it is size 28. Please if there's a way I can return this (30) and buy size 28 I'll be glad. It is still unworn. Thanks"}
{"label":4,"review":"Dress is pretty, but you got have a decent figure to make it look good.  I'm 175#, and only 5'2\\\\\",...  so it looked pretty frumpy on me.  Would look great on a taller person.  Good luck."}

{"label":3,"review":"Swapped over to this wallet a couple of weeks ago.  It fulfills my main objective of forcing me to hold less in my wallet.  While there are three slots on each side for cards, but realistically only slots 2 & 3 are usable for cards, slot 1 is a little too shallow - but useful for tucking in a receipt or ticket.  Additional cards can be slotted in via the horizontal pockets behind the card slots.  Whole wallet isn't very high, so notes need properly sliding into the bill fold area, not stuffed!  Leather is nice and soft.  As a tip for folks trying to remove stuff from your wallet, I now have images stored on my cell phone of my freq flyer cards and other non essentials such as AAA - basically any card that isn't used for swiping."}
{"label":2,"review":"Looks good"}

{"label":4,"review":"Lovely fabric.  Looks great with jeans for happy hour and would look killer with a skirt and heels.<br \/><br \/>Very, very pleased at the fit.  Nice darts in the mid-section, hem is long enough to cover all the important stuff in this era of low-cut jeans and the drape at the neck is classy and not too daring."}
{"label":0,"review":"This item was not what I expected. It was not as thick as I thought it is a very thin fabric. I expected it to be like a tube top material. If you want something thin then you will like this. I didn't."}
{"label":3,"review":"Satisfied"}
{"label":0,"review":"My daughter is still fitting in 12-18 months in most brands. This 24 month outfit fit more like her 12-18 month outfits. It was so cute that when I tried it on her and saw it wasn't any bigger than her current outfits, I decided to keep it anyway. However, as I went to take it off after 5 minutes of having it on, the seam on the pants had come undone! This was NOT tight on my daughter, so it is just an inferior product.<br \/>Thankfully, I hadn't even removed the tags. It is going back!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Totally loved it as it fits exactly the way I wante dit to be. I like the color of shirt also."}
{"label":4,"review":"Awesome!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this to wear on the weekends to relax. It fits the bill perfect. This is not going to support you like your VS bra. It does however keep the girls supported enough to toss on a tee and pop into the shops. Also if you're in a tank, the lacy straps are very pretty. I'm a 34D and the large was perfect."}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered these dresses for my flowergirls. Long story short, I ended up needing another dress in a size\/color combination that wasn't available anymore. So I contacted the seller, and they immediately sent me friendly information about returns. A couple days later, the exact dress I needed became available, and they called me, asked if I wanted it, and worked with me through the whole process until I was able to get the dress. They were AMAZINGLY friendly, and I would recommend buying from them at all times. Not to mention the dresses are gorgeous, the perfect yellow, and I can't wait to see all my flowergirls in them at my wedding!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Three of the four were true thirty threes.  On one pair, the front button seemed to be set back about a quarter of an inch further than on the other three, which caused the fit to be a bit snug,  Quality seems to be good."}

{"label":0,"review":"Bought 4 of these and wore one of them 3x's and have a small hole in the arm already :("}
{"label":2,"review":"Fits and looks beautiful. The size was perfect for bust area, but too confining in stomach area, was hoping for a more A-line fit. Could wear it with spanx, but I would not be able to eat."}
{"label":2,"review":"Quality is generally"}
{"label":4,"review":"Fit well and a decent quality."}
{"label":4,"review":"The image attached to this item is very low-resolution, so I was hesitant to order. It came in the mail today and I'm completely satisfied. The shirt is your garden-variety T-shirt. The dalek and text are clearly visible and a bit larger than the item's preview picture led me to believe. I'm very happy with this purchase!<br \/><br \/>I'd also like to point out that the image is not silk-screened onto the shirt; the image is dyed into the shirt, so it won't flake off after a few months."}
{"label":4,"review":"I just bought these for my daughter after purchasing several other jeans in this brand that she is very happy with. These jeans fit true to size, and are the same high quality I have come to expect from Agave. They are just the tiniest bit distressed along the pocket and hem, but not anywhere else.  At 11 oz, the material is mid-weight, but it has a light summery feel to it--great for warm weather, comfortable without being too thin...The fabric is smooth and very soft, and the color is a very pretty pale yellow.  The picture certainly does not do these jeans justice!  Just look at the picture of the model wearing the blue Paloma jeans for a better idea of how these will look. They are a form-fitting skinny jean with a mid-rise hitting several inches below the waist--not too low. The only downside is the very long inseam, but that is not a big deal. They have a young, casual rather than dressy look and would be cute for out on the town wear, but IMO they would be less versatile than most jeans simply because of their light color; anything outdoorsy, and you would have to be careful where you sit!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought it to wear as a dress. It fit snug and was comfy and warm. I got many compliments! :)<br \/>I ordered a small which fit perfectly on my  5'4, 110 lbs frame."}
{"label":2,"review":"It was great! I used it for a class project as the hair for Paul McCartney model. I did have to cut the netting a bit to have it fit on the head model but it worked great for a 1970's Paul look!"}

{"label":4,"review":"Beautiful."}
{"label":4,"review":"Not really white, but very comfortable and well made..."}
{"label":1,"review":"The socks are great socks but the opening is so small, I can't get my foot in without a struggle.  Need to know about the size being for a smaller foot.  I wear 8.5-9.5 shoes usually so these may be for a 5-7 or smaller foot."}
{"label":4,"review":"The shirt has nice, bright colors. It fits great, just expect for it to be slightly long."}
{"label":4,"review":"Purchased for my wife and she loves it. Fits perfectly and much higher quality than some cheaper flight jackets we've seen.<br \/>VERY HAPPY with this purchase."}
{"label":3,"review":"I am a big fan of patterned or unique-style jeans...have tons of them! Saw these and loved the bleach look. They were also a steal so I thought why not try? I bought them in my regular size 27 and they totally fit.  Even got some compliments on them the first time I wore them out. I did not give them 5 stars because after wearing them, they did stretch out a little more than I would've liked. They didn't become oversized or slouchy...I just would've preferred for them to keep their tighter fit in the beginning. If I had to do it over again, I would have gone with the size down, a 26. Still for under $25...great buy!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Comfortable and fit well.  However, the material at the inner corner of the bra (the inner corner of the cup openings) tore on both sides after a couple of months of nursing usage."}
{"label":4,"review":"I'm a 4x.  Buying clothes without trying them on is a gamble, but this one fit well.  I like vests because they keep me warm without keeping me hot."}
{"label":3,"review":"It's a good costume for the price, but the zipper is very flimzy and keeps coming apart.  My daughter is a medium and thankfully we ordered a large-- it just barely fits."}
{"label":3,"review":"So it should be noted that this is a JUNIOR dress, so the sizing is junior sizing.  If you are not a junior, you may need to size up.  I ordered a Large and it was too small, so I ordered an XL and it is too big.  SO sad because this really is a beautiful dress!!  It is well made, and the style is lovely!  It comes with a satin shawl.  There is some boning in the bodice which helps it to keep its shape."}
{"label":4,"review":"From reading the other reviews, I honestly wasn't expecting the best product. And it's not expensive, so I figured even if it's not a great shirt, it's not that big of a deal. Well, I really like it. It's very high-quality material and the price can't be beat. I'm 6'4&#34; and about 185 lbs, and I ordered the Asian XL \/ US L. It fits perfectly. The length is great in both the torso and the arms."}
{"label":3,"review":"Nicely made, fits better than other hats I've ordered through Amazon."}
{"label":4,"review":"This hat was given to my mom as a Mother's Day present.  She has a very small head and the adjustable band makes the hat fit.  The brim is also wide enough but not too wide for a small head.  It rolls up beautifully!  My only suggestion is that would be to add a chin string for those really windy days!"}
{"label":1,"review":"I'm short-waisted and frequently buy tops from the petite section, but this shirt is too short.  Had to wear it for pajamas, because I would NEVER wear it in public."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very Very comfortable and the cushioning is great for my feet. I have Plantar Fasciitis so sometimes I like something a little thicker but not so thick that I feel like I'm wearing winter socks, these are the perfect in between."}
{"label":0,"review":"The shirt colors are not bold AT ALL, the front has zero shape and just hangs, thie neckline is much higher than the picture (think t-shirt neck not at all scooped like the picture). Maybe I assumed it was a cotton or flowy shirt but its a god awful polyester material. The back is cute, however I will be returning it. Did I mention it took a month to get here???"}
{"label":2,"review":"It's a cute vest in the picture. Get at least 2 sizes bigger than you think as you will not be able to button it and the arm holes tend to cut in to you on the front of the arm hole.  It's still stylish to wear open but not as I intended to wear."}

{"label":3,"review":"I really like this style. The shoulders are a little tight and the sleeves a little too short but I expected this as I have broad shoulders and long arms and I nearly always run into this problem. The shirt is attractive and doesn't have gapitis in the bust area.  I would reccommend this shirt for casual go to wear. It is attractive enough for work but goes right out for a casual get together with friends."}

{"label":3,"review":"The Squeem works great to help slim out my stomach. The only thing I don't like is I have 50\\\\\" hips with 40\\\\\" waist the Squeem tends to bunch up if I bend over. I have to pull it down to keep it in place. The strapes sometimes cut into my shoulders. I'm 5'4\\\\\" weigh @ 215 lbs. and got the 2 XL, I think I should have gone a size down. I still like how it works in sliming out my waist, would definatly recomend. Husband loves how it makes me look."}
{"label":4,"review":"I love these! I was surprised how &#34;small&#34; they are for a medium. I am glad I didn't get the small, because they would've been pretty tight. These definitely aren't tight, just a little more snug then I thought, which is actually a good thing. the pictures make them look long and loose, which they aren't. They are very soft too. I have a 31&#34; waist and these are pretty much perfect for me,  but I could see them being too tight for anyone above a 34&#34; waist.<br \/><br \/>Buy these! Much better than Jockey."}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice. I  5' 4&#34; and it comes just mid-knee length. Nice satiny feel that slides with you when turning in bed and doesn't pull all the covers with you. It's pretty and appears to be well made. If you are looking for warm, however, this is not the choice. Fit is perfect to size for me. May consider more if I can find some additional colors. I have only just received it. I can't speak to how well it will wear in the long run."}

FYI, the 2T size is bit big on my 18 month old, who is 25 pounds and 2 ft. 9 inches tall.  I roll the sleeves 1 cuff and it looks great, with room to grow.  Very cute!"}

{"label":2,"review":"These briefs are reasonably well-made and the materials are perfectly fine for the price.  I have been buying much more expensive briefs for several years and decided to save some money on these.  Now I remember why I paid the premium for designer briefs: Hanes just doesn't get the waistband right.  OK, it may just be me, but the waistband on these rolls over so that I get a very narrow waistband.  Others don't seem to do this.  Still, for the money, they're OK.  But just OK."}

{"label":4,"review":"Five stars for being a real nice top. But it was only worn once because it was ridiculously big. I didn't care much for the arm hole showing my bra. I'm a 36B with an athletic build."}
{"label":2,"review":"Contrary to the popular belief of the people who call this material \\\\\"paper\\\\\", it is not, in fact, paper. Granted, it seems like paper, *extremely* thin with a slightly coarse paper-like texture. However, the fact is that this is indeed a microfiber-based wallet, and hence *will not* rip, even if you try. If it's your first time holding one, you'll think you've been ripped off with a wallet made of folded paper. It doesn't help that you can literally unfold the wallet completely and make it look like a standard sheet of paper with a design on it. But trust me, this is extremely durable material with dense-as-hell microfiber.<br \/><br \/>Having said that, these wallets were really made for style. They're for everyday use, not exactly a businessman's wallet. So, yeah, the designs are crisp, cool, and should not disappoint, as the designs are perfectly portrayed on the fiber.<br \/><br \/>However, it's hard to argue for the design of the wallet itself when it comes to holding your stuff. First, it's hard to know where to put things. I tried to put my credit cards in the side pockets, but found that it was far too easy for them to slide out with the slightest momentum. So I ended up putting everything up top and in-between the internal compartments (note that there are only two internal pockets, which is just not good enough). If you put your cash and maybe a couple of business cards in the top compartments and your various cards in the two inner compartments, it'll stay as it should--but because there are only two inner compartments, you're always forced to take out *everything* at once in that compartment, because there is no way to sort these. Functionally, it's pretty much a disaster. But if you're not the type to carry around a lot of cards, well, it's not a big deal.<br \/><br \/>I still use them sometimes just if I wake up and feel like it. I own three of these total in different styles, along with some other novelty wallets. I also have a \\\\\"primary\\\\\" wallet that is clearly the best-made wallet of all of them, but it's not particularly pleasing to the eye. Sometimes I just like sacrificing functionality for style on some days.<br \/><br \/>If you don't carry a lot of cards at once, these should work fine. But if you're the type of person who is loaded with cards in their wallets (say, more than six, including your license), these just aren't practical. Cool, but not practical."}

The material and quality of the product are fine."}

{"label":3,"review":"I think the product was great in terms of quality of the fabric, print and finish.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend going up a size.  My boys are small and skinny (5-10h percentile) on the growth curve, so they usually wear 3t (age 4) and 4t (age 6) in other clothes and pajamas.  In these the arms and pant legs are a little short and tight even before the first wash.  We are washing them in cold and not putting them in the dryer so we will get more milage out of them."}

I went looking long and hard for a velour zip up robe and found the very same one in burgundy.  Yep...it's warm and feels good and I don't have to mess around with belts or the annoyance of wrap robes that sort of slide around and look messy on me. Step in and out of this robe...fits beautifully over a nightgown or pajamas or right out of the shower.  I pack it when I travel and it looks good when I take it out of the suitcase and feel as if I'm home no matter where I am.<br \/><br \/>If you're looking for sexy - well, this isn't the robe. Ask my husband...he'll tell you! :)  If you are looking for warmth and comfort with a touch of elegance - this is the robe for you.  With any amount of luck, I'll be wearing this one for a good long time and enjoying it, too.<br \/><br \/>The price...well...I was delighted with that, too.  I'd seen similar robes on other sites for upwards of $60.00. You can't beat the price and the quality is every bit as good as those higher priced robes.  Enjoy yours!"}

{"label":3,"review":"The dress is obviously well-crafted and the fit is great for me. I am about 34\\\\\" 26\\\\\" 38\\\\\", and it fits nicely, but the design only makes my hips look even bigger. I have other peplum items, but I think that the lack of sleeves on this dress accentuates the lower body even more. I had to return it.<br \/><br \/>Sizing: I almost always wear a 2, but based on the manufacturer's sizing chart, I ordered a 4 - fits like a UK8."}
{"label":3,"review":"Love this dress. I checked &#34;fit as expected&#34; but I expected it to fit small. However with the style, it is ok. I normally am a size 14-16 women's. Armholes are not too small or tight on me."}
{"label":3,"review":"I'm just getting back into running after, um, a multi-decade hiatus. Have been looking high and low for something to run in that is comfortable, doesn't ride up, and makes me feel cute despite the extra pounds I'm working off. These totally fit the bill. I put them on and forget they're there, because they cause me no problems whatsoever. The fit is flattering, so I'm not self-conscious. When you combine that with the price, how can you go wrong? I liked mine so much, I bought two more and tend to wear one around the house or while running errands.     I do feel they may run a little large. I'm 5'7\\\\\" and 145-150, but carry most of my weight in my hips\/rear (I'm pretty slight otherwise). I expected to need an XL, but a large fit fine. If you buy a size too big, I think you will have problems with it riding up. I had tried on several other brands at an athletic store prior to stumbling onto these (Nike for one, can't remember the other brand), and those ran ridiculously small (one of them, I couldn't even get the extra large ON. Seriously? I've got a booty, but for crying out loud). The other was too short to accommodate my ample rear, fit me terribly and looked rather obscene. These are a flattering length. If you've had trouble finding an athletic skirt that's flattering, you might give this one a try.    The one shortfall in my mind, and the reason I'm giving them a 4 instead of 5 star review, is that you need to wear panties with these - there's no breathable panel, and the seams are, how shall I say, unfortunately placed. Not a big deal for $17, but just so you're aware. I'd gladly pay more for that feature - less to wear, less to wash... But still would recommend these."}

YEAH SURE THEY ARE, here they are (far right) next to my favourite pair of similar Aeropostale jeans in a 000R (middle) which is a 22-23 waist. Picture quality isn't great but you can see the difference. I bought these expecting small sized jeans. Hemming is one thing. Having enough room in the seat to stuff a copy of the collected Walking Dead volume 1 (or a big Thick Bible) is completely another. I guess I'll keep shopping at Justice. Look, I get that people are all sizes. But the last time I checked, there were plenty of small girls who need slim fit stuff too. It seems that jeans brands are ignoring us tho.<br \/><br \/>The thighs on these are cut to fit a bodybuilding. What the hell? I work out, I have toned thighs. Skinny jeans shouldn't hang off me like they are boyfriend jeans though. I'm athletic sure. But so are lots of girls. What the hell is going on when you buy supposedly super small jeans and they are a joke when it comes to sizing. These are going to Goodwill."}

It would have been better to have solid foam goggles or hollow plastic goggles... They are uncomfortable on any size face...my 5 year old tried it on as well...I realize it's not supposed to be the highest quality design, but a more practical design seems just as cost efficient. Also, one stocking was an inch shorter than the other, but that wasn't noticeable because they would roll down a bit...not a big deal.  The gloves, also, could have been stitched better, but it was a costume for a day, so in general, it served it's purpose."}

{"label":1,"review":"First, the merino wool is only 10% of the composition.  Second, the weave is very loose which means the sock will not be particularly warm with so little wool.  Third, The &#34;logo&#34; is so loosely woven into the sock that the threads will unravel as soon as it is washed and dried.  Fourth, the socks come tightly attached by thread in the packaging, which leads to additional loose threads when the socks are separated."}

The ladies was meant to be a Christmas gift so this really caused me a pain in the neck at the last minute but my husband decided he would just keep the wrong one and wear it so I didn't send it back. It was a little small of a fit for him as its a European cut and he has very muscular shoulders and arms (ex football player) but he likes the heaviness of the performance fabric so he thought he'd try it.

So if I put this on it just squished\/folded my pooch further down over my scar....so that wasn't going to help me any. And when I would kind of lift up my pooch to tighten it at the bottom it would kind of squish all my belly fat upward and it looked ridiculous. I could have never worn this under clothing. If you only gained 20-30 lbs during pregnancy and just have a small gradual post baby pooch this may work for you. But not for me!"}

More fitted in the leg even though they all say  \\\\\"Levi's Women's 515 Bermuda Short\\\\\" and the picture was identical and only the color of the shorts (dark) called \\\\\"rinse blue\\\\\". Maybe also a higher waist. I do like them though."}

{"label":3,"review":"I really like this shirt!  I was a little worried about the neckline based on other reviews...after tightening the adjustable tie (it does go smaller or larger for the opening), it is just perfect.  I don't ever wear low cut things, so it worked out just fine.  I am looking for other items from this company...why you ask?  I loved the price for one thing.  Being a teacher with not much income, it's great to be able to find cute items for not a lot of money!"}

But not when I order the girls' jeans! The size 14 length is perfect! These jeans are a very light weight, jegging type of material. Extremely stretchy and comfortable. The rise is higher than my typical jeans, but as I am post c-section, that is a definite PLUS for me!"}

{"label":0,"review":"Do not buy this shirt unless you prefer a girdle for a work-out shirt.  I've  purchased Champion shirts in the past with a similar experience but thought give them another try.  Never again.  Why a sports company makes such poorly designed and fitting clothing is a mystery."}
{"label":2,"review":"I have a nickel allergy so if I wear a belt without my shirt tucked in, and I would have to do it a bunch of times, it eventually irritates me.  I have bought many belts from this company over the years.  On the one hand, I am grateful that they exist and I can buy a nickel free belt.  So, because I am so grateful, I feel like I can complain a little bit.  These belts don't last long.  The leather tears and breaks after 6 months to a year of almost daily use.  Granted I do wear the brown or the black one every day.  Maybe I should buy a regular belt for when I tuck in my shirt and just use these when I don't but for almost $40 I feel like they should last longer.  Anyway, for the most part, it's great they exist and they are a really easy company to deal with.  I had to return a belt once and it was no problem.  And they were helpful with figuring out the right size.  I wish I could give them 5 stars but the leather just doesn't last."}
{"label":3,"review":"The coat is nice, however, it is close to a slim fit.  I normally wear a 42-44 and the 44 was a snug fit.  I normally go for regular fit 42 but thought maybe a 44 tailored would give me a better look.  For the money, give it a try and hopefully it fits."}

{"label":1,"review":"I love my spanx opaque tights because they have amazing tummy and thigh panels in them and they are durable (I can wear for 2 seasons!). I saw these leggings and thought this was amazing and the ticket for me, even though I had a difficult time with the price :(. Needless to say, they are ok at best. There is no tummy panel like in their tights. The crotch fits funny in that it is not comfortable and the tights are not opaque, I can see my underpants through them. I would consider these leggings, thick cottony tights. Spend your money on the opaque tights, not these. I wear the tights under normal much less expansive leggings and my profile looks flattering and more importantly... I feel confident."}

The fit feels a bit on the &#34;small&#34; side such that the elasticity is really up on the neck; and, I said PERSONAL PREFERENCE. The discomfort could also be due to my non-average sized head.<br \/><br \/>On the side note, I have a large head so the transition from beanie to scarf my be a bit harder for me. Anyhow, they should of at least made each opening maybe ~1\/2&#34; bigger, or have size option! :)."}

You must wear a bathrobe if you plan on walking around your house at all, if there are anyone else other then your significant other present.

I'm just glad I only purchased one of these things as I would feel like I wasted money if I had purchased more."}

Just beware of the sizes if you are taller than 'hobbit'.<br \/><br \/>Also... they smelled super packaged when I got them. I had to clean them right away because it bothered me a lot. But just a minor detail! :)"}

{"label":4,"review":"Even though the fit was slightly larger than I was hoping, I am keeping them and I still love the product. The material is dressy enough and yet can be casual; just slightly longer than I wanted but I should have gone with the petite size. This was not the fault of the seller it is my mistake. Still love these pants though!"}
{"label":2,"review":"This coat fits really small. I wear an XS and the large fit with a little room for a thin sweater underneath. I like the color, but the arms are too short! I am 5.7' and the arms reach slightly above my wrist.  It zips all the way up. The zipper in the neck area is annoying and the jacket is very boxy. I think if would have been better suited for a little boy!"}

{"label":4,"review":"First and foremost, this shirt is stunning in person, I couldn't have been happier with the graphic. This is a must for any Doctor Who fan. The shirt itself is holding up beautifully so far, even after multiple washings. I wash it inside-out on the gentle cycle, and dry it on the lowest setting to help prevent \\\\\"cracking\\\\\" on the graphic. It also arrived in a very timely manner. I would definitely order from this seller again.<br \/><br \/>As for sizing, it is a juniors \\\\\"babydoll\\\\\" type fit, so I would consider sizing up if you are one of those ladies that have a larger bust. For reference, I typically wear a S\/M in women's shirts, 5'4\\\\\", roughly 130lbs, size 34DD bust. I ordered this in an XL to be on the safe side. It was a little larger than I expected; a large probably would have sufficed, but I hate wearing shirts that pull at my chest. After a few runs through the dryer, it fit perfectly.<br \/><br \/>I highly recommend this shirt. I've received many compliments from complete strangers while out in public - great way to meet a fellow Whovian :)"}

{"label":2,"review":"I love these pull-on leggings but they could fit a bit better.  The leg size and length are great but maybe because I'm a bit short-waisted they are a bit large through the crotch and waist.  I kept them because they'll never be worn with a shirt tucked in but look great under long tops. Very cool faux leather look with mesh cutouts. Wore them in Italy and got a few nice comments.  Yay!"}

Really flatters the curves while hiding the lumps and doesn't stretch or sag after hours of wear.  I also bought these in the Ash colour as I loved them so much.  Highly recommended."}

{"label":3,"review":"Very soft.  I wear it as a pajama top. It's a little bit tighter than I thought it would be, but it still fits, and it's plenty comfortable. (Normally I'm a medium, but since it's a Junior tee, I should have gotten a large.) Shiny, thanks!"}

It arrived on the expected day.<br \/> Great costume for the price- doesn't look cheap and came with several accesories( hat, pirate booty pouch).<br \/><br \/>The skirt is short and you will need to buy a black petticoat to go underneath if you want it to look like the picture.<br \/><br \/>I purchased the black petticoat from Leg Avenue and and it really completed the look.<br \/><br \/>The whole costume fit as expected - I am 5'7 130 lbs 34D and I ordered a small.  The top was low cut, I wore a black bandeau underneath for the adult costume party.  For handing out candy, I put a black tank underneath.<br \/><br \/>The hat came scrunched up, I just stuffed it and let it sit for a few days and the wrinkles came out.<br \/><br \/>The sleeves looked good with the costume, a little scratchy and annoying after a few hours but they stayed up, never fell down.<br \/><br \/>I bought several add-on accessories to complete this look- the petticoat, red and black striped boot covers, a garter, black fishnets and gold-like coin necklace and large gold hoop earrings.<br \/><br \/>I got lots of compliments, very good costume for the price.

INSANE. They were impossiblly challenging to wrestle even part way up my thighs. I have never struggled so much to put any item of clothing or lingerie.on. I ordered a 4x and these felt like a small or medium. They look at first glance like a XS or child's size. They should be banned from even selling these as advertised"}

{"label":4,"review":"I Have Tryed on wigs in the past, but this is the first wig i put on, that i fell in love with. the color is perfect to the photo, as well as the style. the only down side was the back seemed rather to short, until I did something htey say you should not do with wigs. I took a noraml Human hair brush to it, the ones that have the soft brissle lieks to it. when i got the wig it was stiff feeling, and i thought, \\\\\"'oh great, not gonig to be fun to cut and style, not worth my money' but boy was i wrong, i put it on, night snug perfect fit, and started to brush it out. the fibers grew insanly soft, starting to feel like real hair! and then when i started to cut it, it cut jsut liek human hair to, so nice and easily, and now the wig is perfect for my cosplay for Matt from Death Note, and by what i said early the back being to short, just brushed it a bit and it came longer. SO worth the little price they want for this! (Sorry for spelling mistake, jsut to late at night) But this product is worth what ever they want for it, just simple stuff makes it feel so real! I love this wig! at times, i acauly forget i am even wearing it! and with all the paretns and head band i wear under this to keep my natrual hair out of the way, it dotn change the product, i dont notice any bumps even if i have them in my real ahir and stuff, it makes it just a perfect fit, and look!

{"label":4,"review":"What the product info didn't make clear about these shorts was that the hip pockets are actually incredibly deep (a good feature imo). They go all the way down to the bottom of the thigh cargo pocket. You could probably fit a psp in one of them. I can even fit my 32 ounce water bottle in it (of course it bulges all over the place and I look stupid when I do this). The right hip pocket also has a secondary pocket in addition to the deep pocket. This second pocket is about the size of a normal jeans pocket.    Cargo pockets and back pockets are secured with velcro patches    I wish they offered some longer inseam lengths. I got the size medium with 9 in inset. The shorts are about 2 inches above the top of my knee when standing but I like shorts that go past my knees. They're hard to find though."}
{"label":0,"review":"Although the mask is pretty, it came with the feathers completely blocking the left eye hole.  The feathers are secured and not adjustable.  The seller is ignoring me so I can't even get it exchanged\/returned and I paid extra for fast shipping all gone to waste.  My only option is to cut the feathers diminishing the mask's look so don't fall from one eye hole blocked or buy another.  Find another seller who believes in customer service if you want this product."}

It has a good feel around the waist, does not leave a space at the back at all, the legs are not too tight, but not at all loose  The color is just right, and overall I feel very well wearing it.<br \/>The size and length are perfect. I am very pleased with this item."}

{"label":4,"review":"For the money, you can't beat this vest set. My groomsmen will be using these for my upcoming wedding and honestly, the quality for a potential 1-use-item is surprisingly good. When I received mine last week, I ironed it on a medium setting and it didn't burn. Additionally, the color was pretty similar to what is pictured, although the beige has a slight gold tint to it, which is exactly what I wanted so that they could match with our wedding colors."}

I advise ordering this in time for alterations not a last minute order would wear again after alterations \u2665"}
{"label":2,"review":"Price was right for a one or two time wear, but not made as well as I expected. The edges of the top are not done and are a little scraggly. On the small size, my baby is 11 mos and it just fits. She is 21 lbs."}

It was way too large; i would estimate it to be about a size 16.  The material is substantial weight but a little shiny, which i'm not sure i liked.  I found another skirt i like better which has normal American sizing so i'm not going to order the Doublju skirt again.  i avoid all the vendors with the foreign sizing issues when i can - not good for me as a consumer and creates a lot of inconvenience."}

My daughter looks like a miniature me. This item arrived in a super fast time"}

{"label":2,"review":"I was not given a choice of size so I figured it was one size fits all. I wear an 8 so if you are larger it will be very hard to pull up. That said, it does fit snug so holds me in which is good. The problem is the picture depicts a very small woman and she must be very short. I'm 5'6&#34; and it doesn't fit the length that shows in the picture. If I do pull it down low, it rolls up when I sit. If this was about 3-4&#34; longer it would be better. I'm not sure what the infrared really does but it does help keep my tummy in while going about my day."}

{"label":3,"review":"This top is super cute. I order a medium and fit just right. It arrived sooner then it's original arrival date, which was a plus. The only reason I didn't give it the 5 starts is because some of the lettering started to fade and I only wore it twice. But other than that for the price it is its a great top."}

Would definitely order from this company again."}
{"label":4,"review":"excellent, I was very satisfied"}
{"label":3,"review":"The measurement of the belt could have been more specific.  The measurement for its X Large version says it is from 39&#34;-43&#34;.  I know for a fact that my waist is 40&#34; as that is the waist measurement for all shorts and pants I currently wear.  Yet, when I put on this and the other belts I bought of this brand, the belt made it around my waist just enough so that only the first hole was available for the prong of the belt buckle.  Other than that, I praise this company for having the creativity, or at least willingness, to offer more colors than just black or brown and for providing such a wide array of colors to boot.  I do wish they had more colors, but more importantly, I wish that their measurements were more accurate."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very good nice"}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought two of these for Christmas for myself and my father. When they arrived, I opened them both just to check that they were both what I ordered, then I tried mine on. I was immediately pleased with both the size, design, and the function. My father and I both have big hands, so I ordered XL for both of us, and they fit perfectly. Just make sure you select the right standard size, and you'll be fine."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good friend of mine recommended I should get this hat. I really enjoy it! If you have a large head, definitely go the L\/XL to be safe. The M\/L is a bit snug - just takes getting used to though."}
{"label":3,"review":"The socks are of very good quality and the print on them is adorable.  The size I ordered was a medium for my 6 yr old and they are a bit too big but I'm sure she'll grow into them in no time! The socks come in individual packaging\/each which was pretty cool."}
{"label":1,"review":"This thing was huge"}
{"label":4,"review":"Everything was as advertised! Shirt is awesome and just as it looked on the website. Though it is a little large, it should hopefully shrink in the wash, which is why I went for a little larger on the size.Everything was as advertised!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I was looking for a leopard print scarf that had different sized spots.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Love the colors - just as pictured.  Inside the shipping envelope, it was packed in one of those clear crinkly plastic bags, so I was a bit worried about the quality at first.<br \/><br \/>I opened the bag and there is zero chemical factory smell.  Once I fluffed the scarf a bit, it has a GORGEOUS shape.  Most of my thinner summer scarves need quite a bit of fussing with to get the right shape or to fluff up.  This one is SO easy to shape and has just enough &#34;texture&#34; to hold the shape pretty well.  LOVE it!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Other legwarmers we've tried have been too big, these fit my 3 year old well (although I'm sure they'd be good for older too) - and they are cute!"}
{"label":4,"review":"This dress runs a bit big, but it's beautiful, especially for the price.  It's comparable to a dress you'd find at a big name bridal store, but for a fraction of the cost."}
{"label":2,"review":"The material is rough and the color on the skirt is hot  pink. The black thread shows through the skirt."}
{"label":3,"review":"It's a nice looking warm jacket that isn't bulky. I like the zippered front with snaps, and also the zippered hood with a collar that snaps at the neck. I'd give it 5 stars if it had additional fabric on the sleeves for extra warmth and zippered pockets. My 18-year-old daughter likes it too."}
{"label":4,"review":"Exactly the fit and color I was looking for in a dress sock.  Love these for work! Much better than knee high nylon stockings. Tried out one pair first and then ended up buying 6 more!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Made a little larger than I expected, but it looks great and wears very well."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought these for my son who is stationed in Iraq and he likes these very well. He said they even did great all by themselves as socks."}
{"label":4,"review":"Fast & Smooth Shipping, Excellent Product!"}
{"label":2,"review":"It does provide protection, but it is a little big and often slips off and has to be pulled back over to cover the I-pad.  In other words, it's a little loose, but just a little."}
{"label":2,"review":"The length of the dress was shorter than I expected. The material is flimsy and some of the sequence were falling off."}
{"label":2,"review":"The bottoms are as round as the tops.  I feel silly wearing them.  I don't go out of the house.  They are comfy, but nothing sexy about them."}

{"label":3,"review":"Good. Maybe suits for white wooden clogs."}
{"label":3,"review":"Beautiful dress, fit a little small around the arms.  Nice material, washes well, definitely high quality and I love the print."}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered these socks and liked them so much that I ordered more.  so far... very soft, fits well, not like wrapping your foot in cashmere, but not far off.  I like the combination of merino and cashmere. the price is fair for the quality of the product."}
{"label":1,"review":"These did not accomplish what it's meant to. My hands were still freezing in them. Maybe it was because of my sweaty hands. I don't know."}
{"label":2,"review":"The arm hold on this dress is too small. Thinking about returning it."}
{"label":4,"review":"A beautiful color.Washed in hot water to bleed out excess color, washing darks together, but they were all colorfast and didn't bleed. Also used hot dryer for maximum shrinkage. Only shrunk about 2\\\\\" length and 1\\\\\" width as expected. They start out a little larger to allow for that. Now they are perfect. They have a medium height waistline, but my large fits just like a typical large size. I don't like to be constricted in any way when I sleep.. But did I mention how very soft they are?  There is nothing like a pair of pajamas made of 100% cotton flannel! Now I will never accept anything less.In addition to all of that, everything about them says quality!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Neck was a little floppy but overall it was good"}
{"label":3,"review":"great"}

{"label":4,"review":"My wife had one of these and I decided to buy her another as a gift. It is 100% egyptian cotton. I could not find this anywhere! I found it here, though, finally. The cotton is very light, it's much more sheer than a traditional type t-shirt or tunic. It's not see through, it's just very light weight. Perfect for hot, hot summer days or sleepwear when you want to cover up but not roast. The length helps with that, too. I've seen this worn as a shirt, a night shirt, a swimsuit cover up, and lightweight under shirt. Looks good, nice quality. One caveat: you have to wash it very, very gently because the cotton will fall apart under regular wash and dry. This needs hand washing and a drying rack. Other than that, it's great! Go for it!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Very pretty , I ordered a large with 38Ds they are a bit squished but I feel very secure in this, gives you a bit of nice cleavage too"}
{"label":4,"review":"Perfect!"}
{"label":0,"review":"Terrible quality.  Donated it to a crafter who might be able to use some of the fabric.  Sewing is jagged, cut is useless for something marketed as stretchy or fitted."}
{"label":4,"review":"I am 5'7&#34;, 150 lbs.  Tired of being told I am too skinny or look sick, I have had difficulty finding the right fit in a dress shirt.  Typically men's medium look like a sack in the middle, and small is too tight in the arms & shoulders.  This shirt fit like it was tailored, only a little snug in the forearms - perfect everywhere else.  Fabric has a nice sheen and construction appears to be as good as any other ready-to-wear. I will buy more of these"}
{"label":4,"review":"My grandaughter's mother, my daughter, liked it very well indeed. She approved of her daughter wearing the dress. Thank you very much."}

{"label":2,"review":"My 75134 Vanity Fair bras are still lasting, even though I finally had to stitch up where the wire had poked through the underarm edge where it had worn out from wear - It is the only bra I can keep on my narrow shoulders, especially being 40DD.  Finding the bra again in the hard to find black but in the 76134, I thought I was receiving the identical bra or as close to identical that you can get.  And it is .. in style and shape.  But wear?  The first time I wore it, I could feel and see a stretched area between the straps and the hooks in the inside back on both of the sides.  The material that goes around the chest is just quite inferior to the original.  And the straps are rougher.  I will continue to look, probably in vain, for 75134 old stock."}
{"label":3,"review":"My elderly mother has enormous lower legs and swollen feet, i.e., severe edema. I am always looking for good quality extra-extra-roomy socks. These fit fine and looked fine. I'm giving these a four-star rather than a five-star rating because they do not look like they will hold up to the wear and tear of repeated washing over many years...but with my mother's fragile health, that is not important."}

I was worried that I would get the wrong size or wouldn't like the look once I got it but decided to take a chance. I'm very glad I did! The belt looks great with jeans or dockers and the size was perfect. The width is 1 3\/4\\\\\" and the length for the 38 is about 46\\\\\" from tip of buckle to end of belt. I wear 36-38 pants and this is the perfect size."}

{"label":3,"review":"Fits well. Stiff hat, could use a little more ventilation .  Overall a solid hat at that price point."}
{"label":4,"review":"My wife purchased these as an alternative to her normal brand that had become unavailable. The fit is good and they have comfortable, breatheable fabric."}
{"label":2,"review":"These are nice quality and not shiny, but they only come in one size that is significantly smaller than the M in the faux leather leggings from the same brand."}
{"label":4,"review":"I just received my package and tried it on. I am size 8-10, so I went with the XL size. I was worried being D-DD cup it is very diffcult to find the bra that fits well. So far, I was able to fit everything in without any problem. It looks exactly as on the picture. Some reviewers complained about the dots beeing to big, I wouldn't say they are bigger than what's on the picture. They are less than a penny - just regular-looking polka dot. I enjoy it so far and I am glad I get to go to the beach tomorrow."}

{"label":0,"review":"When I bought these they had no reviews and they were cheap so I said what do I have to lose and I bought them didn't think much of it and threw them in the wash with my other close. They stank like chemicals, stained my other clothing with the same smell, threw them out and had to rewash and the scent still stains my other clothing, might have to do a third wash. I am so annoyed, I didn't even know they were from china till i looked at the order and I didn't think much of it but now I know don't buy any clothing from china just sub-par by a lot."}
{"label":4,"review":"This shirt is just right.  Good fit, well made, good material used, heavy but not too heavy.  Love the pockets with the flaps."}

{"label":3,"review":"Okay. Let me just start by saying I don't believe this deserves a four stars more like 3 &1\/2 but that is not an option. I'll say why in a second.<br \/><br \/>My purposes for this wig? I'm in the production The Rocky Horror Picture Show and my costume designer loves the idea of skanky weirdos . i'm not big on anime though most of my fake day are but that's irrelevant.<br \/><br \/>Why do I give 3 & 1\/2 stars? The wig...in my experience tangled too easily for my purpose. It came right smack on time. I was super excited. Opened it up right away. Great packaging. Professional. Never bought a wig so I was slightly on edge but not knowing what to expect  . Very pleased with what I recievied. Nice color. Gorgeous color. super long ...could be thicker but still great. easy to brush through.<br \/><br \/>Where does my problem lie. now this wig Is great but for my uses not so much. I wore it to ONE rehearsal and has many dancing scenes and run throughout of the TIME WARP. By the end of the might which was only there hours. it was tangled. To the max. I got tips on how to fix it and I tried everything and it still tangled. I like the wig enough where I will keep it and wear it for fun . To be honest it's more likely to be my fault it tangled but again i'm not pro wigs. I have no idea really if they should liveebbthrough such storms.<br \/>This wigs was in such great quality before I ruined it that I proceeded to order another from the same buyer. i'm in love with this wig and the new one will stay in packaging until showtime lol but I Wiillc buy from this person again. great quality but i'm just not happy with how easy it tangled so I believe it deserves a four or 3 &1\/2 I do suggest this wig to others its worth the money and more :)"}
{"label":3,"review":"This was one of six items I bought from Patty Women as a first time customer. I had been eyeing some of their clothing on Amazon for several weeks. I was a little skeptical. They had such high ratings and women gushed about the products. Yet there there were no uploaded photos from customers. The products were a lot of money for me- especially for clothes I couldn't try on. Would I have to return all of them because they didn't fit or look right?<br \/><br \/>As a 35 year old mother, I try to dress nicely but with a large bust sometimes that is hard. I normally wear a women's L\/XL on top and am a 36G. I bought an XL and this fit me perfectly. The sleeves aren't too tight. The sleeves are a little long- but I like that. The back of this isn't really as long as I'd like, but I still like it. It's different than anything else like this that I own. It would make for a cute yoga jacket. Other color options are available at the Pattyselections website which I wish I had known, but the black and dark grey of this is cute. I can easily wear it with jeans or black yoga pants. I think you could even dress it up a little. It's not too warm, but it is cute.<br \/><br \/>Very happy with this purchase but wish the back was just a tad longer."}
{"label":2,"review":"The suit is absolutely adorable and exactly as pictured. I followed the reviews and purchased an XXL (ouch!) as I'm a size 10-12 with a very large bust. The bottom and waist fit great, except the bust is just a tiny bit too small. I'm keeping the suit hoping that things will &#34;adjust&#34; and fit a little better when I lose a few pounds. I wouldn't recommend this suit for anyone with a small\/medium bust -- it'll be way too big up top."}

But they are tight.  So even though the pants say 35&#34;, they aren't.  They are more like 34: or even smaller.  The jacket and vest both fit fine though.  I do like the suit, aside from the pants being too small."}

She had fixed up an old uniform that is about 40 or more years old and made it fit her skin tight and short. She even made a great looking nurse's cap and a cape, to boot! We've had some fun with it many times over the years, and it's still in very good shape. I thought this outfit looked very sweet and got it for her as a surprise gift. It's well made and quite stirring when she's in it. All I can say is &#34;Thumb's Up&#34;! Another good thing was the prompt and efficient shipment by the vendor. It's all good!"}

Construction felt rather flimsy however it was still holding together well when I stopped using it.   Might have held on to cards better if I stuffed it more but the point of a slim wallet is to carry less.  Much prefer the bulkier but much more secure SpecOPS T.H.E.

While not a heavy-weight fleece material, this jacket is plenty warm enough and even kept me comfortable in our most recent &#34;polar vortex&#34; event at -20F....with just a long-sleeve T under it.  The color is not as vibrant a red as I would have preferred, but very attractive nonetheless.  Love the zip pockets, drawcord bottom, and elastic at sleeves.<br \/>Purchased the same in dark green and it is just as comfortable and warm.  An excellent value!"}

{"label":3,"review":"Based on the number of high reviews, I recently ordered a pair.  A number of reviewers mentioned that the shorts run a bit small and recommended ordering one size larger.  In my case, I found that to be untrue.  I have a 42&#34; waist and normally buy XL, but I ordered a XXL.  When I received my shorts, I found them to be a little larger than expected.  It appears they actually run true to size.  I took a ride and found the shorts to be quite comfortable, but because of the larger, loose size of the liner, the pad shifted a lot.  The pad itself does a great job doing what it is supposed to do.  I could have rated it 5 stars, but I like regular hip pockets and these shorts don't have them; however, I definitely recommend them.  I'm ordering another pair, but in in my usual size XL."}
{"label":0,"review":"I ordered two pairs in different colors in one size larger (taking advice from the reviews). One pair was near perfectly sized while the other was noticeably larger. When I hold the waists together, you can see one pair had an extra two inches to the waist. The inseam has an additional 4 inches as well so they drag the ground on the back of my legs.    I was able to get a refund from Amazon, which was awesome. They actually refunded the full amount and I only returned the oversized pair, which was even more awesome. So that's five stars to them. As for the other pair of pants that fit, the seem to get more and more uncomfortable the more they get washed. I would have expected them to have broken in by now but no such luck. I did essentially get them for free so I can't complain too much but they are pretty awful pants.    Again 5 stars to Amazon for their customer service."}

They are super comfy. But, they pilled like crazy!  I would recommend line drying yours for sure. I really like the high waist- you can scrunch, fold like yoga pants or leave it up. At my height, the band goes right up to my bra."}
{"label":4,"review":"I've had this on for 6 hours and it is still going. It hasn't been hot at all. I've always been bigger up top than bottom but this thing really gave me a waist. I went from looking like a pencil, to curvy. I went out tonight with it on an received ALOT more attention than i normally do. As far as the rubber smell, i didn't even notice it with my clothes on. I wore a t-shirt between my skin and the Squeem because I have sensitive skin. Uhrm, if you are a big person, i could see how this wouldn't give you the results you want. I am small. My pants size is a size 3 junoirs, not women. It got rid of my extra pudge. I honestly have no idea where it went. This has made me feel so beautiful. I've always had self-esteem and this helped. I hugged tons of people today and nobody new i even had it on. a few people thought i had been working out and it was new muscle.

That is great if you throw this dress in a suitcase and you pull it out it will not have any wrinkles. But remember it will show any 'bumps' in your figure. So if you have a concern with tummy control, this might not be the most flattering dress. However it is nothing a spank undergarment can't control."}

Wife wore some sexy boots she already had which coincidentally nearly matched the ones pictured, and we had a great time with this outfit, during and after the party.<br \/><br \/>Good costume. The only thing I would buy to replace it is the nearly impossible to find and crazy expensive plunging neckline version from Deanna Troi \/ TNG, which is what we originally wanted and looked for.

When they arrived, I found that not only did they run slightly smaller than the last pack, but also that they lacked the &#34;wrap-around&#34; fabric over the elastic waist band. This and the rough seams  on hem of leg openings makes them uncomfortable, itchy, and sometimes painful to wear. THEY SUCK. If you consider buying these you would probably be just as well served if you fashioned your own out of burlap and wool. See and it says comfortsoft waist band. These are NOT comfortsoft waistband. Don't buy them. It's a rip-off that will bug you til those drawers wear out."}

Cotton socks will get wet as you sweat and stay wet.  That will cause blisters and painful, achy feet.  End of hike.  Wool wicks the sweat away from your skin and evaporates leaving you feel much more comfortable.  The Wigwam brand of socks are the ones I use year round.  These low cut in the Summer and Fall with shorts and the full length in the Winter and Spring for increased warmth.<br \/>Highly recommended."}

{"label":4,"review":"Great bought another"}
{"label":3,"review":"This is a quality, well-made shirt, but the size was too small.  I had to order the next larger size and I am nowhere near the size I ordered, but the larger size fit, so I settled.  I also prefer a TALL size, but it was not available in the larger size."}

{"label":4,"review":"I'm tall (5'10\\\\\") and often have trouble finding jackets that fit me right. I got a Large and it fits perfectly!! The sleeves are nice and long and I love the elasticized bottom of the jacket to keep cold out, and it helps because it's not as fitted as shown on the model. I've only had it a couple days, so I don't know about wear\/tear but Columbia is one of my favorite brands for durability. Plus the price can't be beat."}
{"label":4,"review":"Needed a light, yet warm robe after major surgery.  This item met my expectations for a reasonable price.  Washes well and is very comfortable.  The stitching is well done and plaids match the seams.  A quality item."}

{"label":2,"review":"I have several similar vests and can easily compare their virtues and faults. This vest is simply okay. The fleece material used is one of the thinnest. It has two open (no zippers) slash outer pockets and the interior has open areas behind  the pockets that can be also be used (but not for anything heavy). It's just a lightweight fleece vest. At almost $30 (cost + shipping), it's okay but nothing special for what it is or what it costs."}

{"label":4,"review":"EXCELLENT"}
{"label":4,"review":"I can honestly say, I've never had a more comfortable pair of underwear. These are SO soft! Truly. The cut is cute and the fit is perfect. They don't ride up or go anywhere that they aren't supposed to. The elastic on the waist is snug, but doesn't cut off circulation. I hate the name (Uranus). Why couldn't they have gone with any other planet name, even \\\\\"not a planet anymore Pluto\\\\\" would have been better. However, these are just so freaking COMFORTABLE. I've been raving about them to everyone I know since I first tried them on.     What made me take a look at these in the first place was the colors, and then the price (3 for $25). The moss green is my favorite. Their website (Uranus') size guide says they run bigger. I chose my size based on AMAZON'S size chart and got a better fit than any other pair I've ever had. Seriously - EVER.     To me, only two cons: the name of the brand and lack of other colors. I do love the colors, but now that I know how SUPER comfy they are, I would love to have tons more in various colors."}

{"label":4,"review":"This hula skirt has an elastic waist so I was leary about how well the one-size-fits-all method would work, but it worked well! I bought 3 of these skirts for a game and knew the adults playing the game varied in height and weight. The skirt fit them all just fine. I was very pleased with this product and would recommend it."}

The size 6 fits her great and they are super cute too! They don't gap in the back when she sits either! (She has another pair of pants that do that and she doesn't want to wear them). Love these jeans! I'll have to buy her more Levi's skinny! ...I hope they all fit like these."}

I tried a bazillion hats to cover it, but too many fell off or didn't look right my head or, most important, felt dumb to wear inside.  This is casual, fits comfortably, is light enough to wear indoors, and doesn't make me look like I'm just leaving to go out.<br \/><br \/>I wanted what was in my youth called a beanie, as in freshman beanie.  Like the ones we wore for choir, sort of like a yarmulke. But beanie now means something like what I call a watch cap. This is a good alternative"}

{"label":2,"review":"Beautiful dress looks exactly like picture. Three stars because it's very cheaply made."}
{"label":4,"review":"Our daughter loves the robe and the color is really nice. Shipment was quick. It was a little confusing to choose the right size because it does not say how long 'S' is or if it is 'S' for toddler or regular 'S' child size."}
{"label":2,"review":"I doubt the waistband will hold up for long. Very flimsy.  Not really a bikini type. Would look better over a depends."}
{"label":4,"review":"got this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it he is 6' 5&#34; and robes are hard to find that fit hes been wearing it almost every night while watching tv and he loves the hood it is very well made and very soft definitely worth the money I was so jealous of it that I ordered one for myself in purple they fit loosely and theres plenty of room for women I suggest going down a size I absolutely love mine also"}
{"label":0,"review":"Great shirt but sizing is off. I almost ordered an extra large because a lot of large shirts are bit small for me. Ordered a large too big. Went to order a medium.....haha $63 bucks. Are you kidding me. If you usually wear a large don't bother or pay 63 bucks."}
{"label":2,"review":"Had to have it taken in. Had i not needed it right away I would have returned it."}

{"label":4,"review":"We needed a red jumper for our daughter's Halloween costume (she was a lobster).  I was surprised at how difficult it was to find what we needed.  Though this is supposed to be for boys, it works great for our daughter.  We now use it every other night as her sleeping outfit.  She loves it; it's warm and soft.  The zipper makes changing her very easy.  Highly recommended."}
{"label":2,"review":"Nice shirt. Nicely made but too small."}
{"label":0,"review":"Will fit a 5 year old."}
{"label":4,"review":"I carry this as my wallet. It holds everything my bifold wallet held in a much more compact package.  The &#34;toffee&#34; color could be called Flat Dark Earth. It matches my Glock's frame."}
{"label":3,"review":"The jacket is lightweight and breathable."}
{"label":4,"review":"The coverup looks exactly as it does in the picture. I like it because you can stay cool and yet the coverup covers. It is a very pretty material. I haven't washed it yet but because it's a polyester synthetic I expect it will wash without any shrinkage. It looks fragile but seems to be a pretty durable material. I usually wear a 6 or 8 blouse but because I'm large on top and didn't want to feel confined, I ordered this in a medium and am extremely pleased that I did. It's perfect."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great shirt on great material. Fits like its sized. Awesome clothing line. Will be buying more. Hasnt seemed like its shrunk at all."}

{"label":4,"review":"Excellent fit!! Hope they bring new colors. Would order one in all colors."}
{"label":2,"review":"This shirt was supposed to be a gift. Beautiful image and good quality fabric. But this shirt is larger than any XL I've ever seen. It's probably 2 sizes bigger than expected. Would love to exchange it but there was NO packing slip or any information with the shirt on how to do so. The was neither a receipt of any kind either. Very disappointed that I can't give this as my gift."}

I came home measured the inseam sure enough the pants were 30x30 but the tag states 30x32(i never washed these pants either). Moral of my story if you buy these pants, try them on first, or you'll be stuck with a pair of capris like me.."}

{"label":4,"review":"I have had this shirt for over a year and can highly recommend it.  The fabric is precisely the right weight for a hot-weather shirt, and, if you choose to iron it (on a low setting, of course) the shirt looks very dressy, retaining the press all day long.  I have gotten many compliments on the shirt and Winniefashion shirts are my first choice for Hawaiian shirts.  By the way, their shirts are all made in Hawaii, just like many other shirts which cost twice as much."}

{"label":0,"review":"the mask shipped looks similar to the one in the photo, but it is not exactly the same. the mask shipped does not have small upper teeth. it has no teeth. the mask is a floppy, rather than stiff, latex material. the mouth buckles and the inside palate flops down over the top of the mouth and hangs down and shows, rather than staying up and holding its shape inside the mouth, and this also obstructs breathing. it is impossible to see out of, and it smells very strongly of sharply toxic chemicals (not just latex). as nice as the photo is, I do not recommend this mask."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great comfort and quality."}
{"label":3,"review":"Nice looking shirt - not sure why one reviewer though it was made with thin material, my shirt was fine, like a normal tshirt.  Overall the quality is good, the sizing was good and the picture looked like it should!"}
{"label":3,"review":"These fit great. Im 6'1&#34; and they are long enough. I bought these to wear under maxi dresses and a jumper to smooth out my thighs. They are comfortable. They aren't thick so you can see through them some. I probably could have gone down 1 size."}

{"label":0,"review":"But the Lord said to Samuel, \\\\\"Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\\\\\"<br \/>1 Samuel 16:7<br \/><br \/>This is the verse I read this morning before getting the squeem delivered.  I'm so glad God's truth was fresh in my mind. Because once I put the squeem on I was light headed & got instant acid reflux. It made me realize that the worlds opinion of me doesn't matter, epecially in light of God's truth.<br \/><br \/>Origionally I thought I could wear the squeem to help pull my abs together during exercise.  It became clear to me that this device was not intended to be worn during exercise.  It's for looks only.  Personally, if looking \\\\\"good\\\\\" according to someone's superficial standard was the goal, score.  But what is the price we are willing to pay to deceptively impress others? Is this really worth it?  Why?<br \/><br \/>If I want to impress others I will not be worried how my stomach looks in my clothes.  I will be looking to help others, to be kind or to share an encouraging word.  LADIES & GENTS if you truly and honestly want to impress others, take your eyes off yourself.  The reality is that no one is really thinking about how you look in a tight shirt anyways, they are too busy thinking about themselves.  Beauty comes from within.  SMILE, LAUGH and be  JOYFUL.

{"label":4,"review":"There are a lot of mixed reviews on this dress and because of that, I can't even count the number of times I added it to my cart and then clicked &#34;save for later&#34;.  I finally accepted that I'd never really know unless I gave it a go. We can't expect every garment to fit every shape perfectly.<br \/><br \/>My body shape is a tough fit.  I'm 5'6&#34; with long legs (40&#34; hips), a high waist (30&#34;) and a naturally large chest (30J)...so finding flattering tops, let alone dresses, is 99% impossible. This dress is in the 1%.  I usually buy tops to accommodate my chest and have them tailored so I don't feel like a block and forego dresses altogether.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately they were sold of out the Large Navy so I took a chance and ordered the Navy in Medium.  I'm glad I did. It fits marvelously!  The tie is in just the right place to accentuate my hourglass shape and V neck styles are most flattering for large chests...making them appear smaller than they actually are.  I like the weight of the material and it stretches enough that I don't feel like I'm going to tear the seams (particularly in the chest area).  It IS however, quite revealing, so either a pin or a camisole underneath will prevent the ladies from making a public debut.  I would recommend wearing a shape smoother underneath because it does show bra and panty lines and if there is backlight, it will shine through the skirt.<br \/><br \/>the dress falls about 2-3 inches above my knee (standing) and rises considerably when sitting (if you don't pull down the back before you sit) so probably not the best choice for a work dress or anywhere else where one may be doing a lot of sitting. That being said, the dress is flirty but has class...Think, sexy librarian meets sailor girl."}

I was expecting it to be a consistent textured silver color, but looking at the picture these seem to be done intentionally. Still seems to be a solid buckle."}
{"label":4,"review":"I usually run a size 6 but I decided to order an 8 because I like to wear pants on my hips (very high waist). These were perfect. Just enough room to where them where I want. They are ridiculously comfortable and look like me that I bought all 3 colors. An added bonus, the buttons and zippers are nickel free. I suffer from a horrible allergy to nickel and recently passed my &#34;tipping&#34; point so now even the smallest contact sends my skin into fits. One bonus of that meant I was able to justify buying new clothes but then I had to find ones I could buy. I contacted Carhartt and a wonderful rep tracked down all the people she needed to and confirmed the El Paso line was safe for me to wear. Yahoo!!! Carhartt has become a new fave of mine. I even ordered the El Paso khaki pants and an El Paso Jacket."}

{"label":4,"review":"Love it!  I have a collection of pashminas and find this one well worth the price. Very soft and cosy against the skin, nice medium-light weight, but warm. The closeup picture is a good representation of the quality weave and fringe.  I bought the pink which looks most like the pink in the four-colors picture shown. I just ordered the lavender as well.  Wish they had more colors as the remaining colors don't suite me. Comes nicely packaged and the label is delicately sewn on so that you can easily remove it with just four quick snips.  I'll be watching for more colors and more Allola products."}

It can work to help provide less of an appetite, however, since there is no curvature and it is very flimsy bendable steel please don't expect it to shape your waist.

{"label":3,"review":"My son insists on sleeping in long-sleeved jammy shirts, no matter the temperature. I bought a couple of these sets and am very happy with them. They are thinner than other brands, which is why I took off one star.<br \/><br \/>FIT NOTE=&#62; As other reviewers have noted, these run very small. I ordered up 2 sizes and they still fit snugly."}
{"label":0,"review":"we ordered it for Christmas. A few weeks later we get an e-mail that it was shipped but lost it's tracking info. They would happily send us another if we wanted to upgrade and send them more money. We declined and thankfully they refunded us our money. The whole thing seemed a bit dodgy. My son would have really liked them but I wasn't up for sending more money to a compant that couldn't keep track of their shipping if they did actually ship the item!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice and lightweight!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Very comfortable, high quality sweater. It's light, so I'm not sure how it will be in a cold winter, but good for taking the chill off otherwise. I hope it holds up well."}
{"label":2,"review":"Very pretty but this is huge!  Doesn't fit as in photo....Flares out at the sides, thus  adding to the birth of body.  It's not flattering and will return."}

{"label":4,"review":"Wow!<br \/><br \/>Such quality<br \/><br \/>Much use<br \/><br \/>So fire<br \/><br \/>Lots proof<br \/><br \/>Seriously, these overalls are excellent! They fit me like a glove, they have just enough material so that its a relaxed fit, but tight enough that they aren't swinging all over the place. They are fireproof. They have taken many welding sparks and not a single hole has been burned in them, even though sometimes I feel the sparks through the pants. No holes. I don't use a welding apron. I am a hobby welder, so if you are a career welder you will probably still want to wear your apron."}
{"label":3,"review":"These shorts are VERY short. It is like wearing boy short underwear. They do not ride up or move at all when you are working out. It seems like it would be good to wear underneath something else! My husband could not keep his hands off of me in these shorts."}

{"label":0,"review":"The sizing is totally off!  Bought XXL for my husband and it is at best a SMALL men's. Returning both!  So disappointed!!"}
{"label":2,"review":"I don't like this bra because it's nearly impossible to feed my son while wearing it. The padding is very difficult to get out of the way of his little mouth, and ends up being his little drip rag!  I didn't give it less than 3 stars because I do like it for when I'm working.  It's much more supportive than other nursing bras I have had, and I can stuff it into my pumping bra and it stays out of the way just fine when I pump."}

{"label":4,"review":"My granddaughter just loves it practically where is it all the time"}
{"label":0,"review":"Simply stated this purchase was not well made.  The seams were stitched unevenly and the ends were full of hanging threads. The knit was thin and had no body or shape to it, This was not inexpensive and I paid for next day delivery so all in all it was a waste of money."}
{"label":4,"review":"My husband loves these. He said they make his junk feel safe. They're expensive but well worth the money."}

{"label":2,"review":"I had to give it to my daughter and it looked beautiful on her!!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Great quality, well made and very warm. Makes a great winter layer under a technical shell. Thicker and more insulation value than a 200 series Polartec fleece. Excellent back, shoulder and arms mobility."}
{"label":2,"review":"I bought this but was disappointed that they had only one size ie 42. I would have liked a smaller size. The jacket is light, material is nice too. It can be worn in summer or when weather is not too cold. It looks really lovely and expensive. I would recommend it to persons who want to look professional but can also be worn on jeans. I am now going to give it to my sibling who I hope fits. Too nice to return but giving it a 3 star rating because it is pathetic that the suppliers only have one size."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought it for my girlfriend and she says its too small but it fits perfectly. they are not too tight on her and they fit to her form fantastically.<br \/>Notes for buyers.<br \/>- they will fit a women's medium waist size Hips 41 inch or smaller any larger may be getting to tight but they are very stretchy and super sexy<br \/>-They cling to the body very well even when peeling off very tight pants, yoga or spandex shorts."}
{"label":0,"review":"I was not happy because I ordered a small and they sent me a XL. The costume was not for me. It was for my daughter who was going to do a play. I think they should pay more attention when they are going to send out what people order."}
{"label":3,"review":"I like to wear fun knee socks when participating in local organized runs, and I ordered these socks to wear at a rock-and-roll-themed 5K.<br \/><br \/>These socks are loose enough that they fit my calves well (my calves are average-sized) and don't cut into my skin the way some socks can.<br \/><br \/>The socks are good quality, so even when they are stretched out, the pattern is still nice and clear.<br \/><br \/>The socks also hold up well to washing, with no discoloration or unraveling.<br \/><br \/>The only minor issue I have is that these socks are quite thin in the footbed, so there is NO padding whatsoever.  That might be a good thing for some people, but I like a little bit more padding."}
{"label":0,"review":"Way too small. Got a medium and it barely fits my ninety pound sister. Other than that I guess it was alright. Material quality wasn't great but it was what I expected."}

{"label":4,"review":"I love Hue sleepwear and have about six different PJ bottoms from them.  They are loose, soft, cute styles and so comfortable.  I always wash them in cold water and do not put them in the dryer - the length stays the same as the day I received them if I treat them well.  PJs bottoms seems to shrink 4-5 inches when put in the dryer and I am tall, so I avoid it."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very good,I love it."}
{"label":3,"review":"The &#34;Ice&#34; color is a very pale blue, and the material is relatively thin, silky, and breathable, making it ideal for skirts and dresses when you don't want to wear panty hose, or have open toe shoes. It smooths out your stomach and crotch area, hiding any bulk, and does not show leg-lines under your clothing. I love them, and am very sad that the model is being discontinued. I have them in every color. I wear the beige ones the most, and after 3 years of wash and wear, they finally managed to get a hole where my thumb nail poked through when I pulled them up. But three years is a good deal for only paying $20. Order one size up for a more comfortable fit."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great and adorable dress. Actually goes to my daughters knees, which is hard to find! Really soft fabric too."}

Every one of them was brightly colored, with vibrant and clear designs.  The sizes all fit well.  I absolutely plan to order more of these shirts in the future."}

{"label":4,"review":"I took a chance and ordered this after reading the other reviews. The color is cute, I think the fit is accurate. I'm kinda small on top and it's a flattering fit. I've worn it twice and washed it once in the washing machine. I let it air dry and it seems fine. I don't know how it will hold up over time since it has underwire but you can't beat it for the price and fit. I will probably order other colors. It shipped very fast from seller too."}

I originally was going to pay full price at a retail store at double the price but figured I would try amazon first. So glad I did! I was able to get two for the price of one!

{"label":3,"review":"First off, let me say, the dress is ADORABLE in person!!<br \/><br \/>However, I ordered the dress based on the measurements listed in the size chart provided and found the item fit NOTHING like it should have once it arrived. Therefore, I have now ordered the next size up and will have to pay for shipping fees all over again.<br \/>I find Amazon.com a fantastic site, but if this continues to happen, I will most likely find myself second guessing future orders..."}

She was SO CORRECT!!!  The last time I wore my shoes, I had blisters. I got my socks today & wore them with my shoes. They were amazing!!  They are slick, so your feet don't stick in the shoes. Plus there is a small oval gel cushion, that is going to save from any more blisters!  VERY happy with this purchase!!"}
{"label":2,"review":"I used this for Halloween.  It is very dark green and quite full with arm holes to allow movement.  I am a fairly large person and 5'6 but it was big enough to fit over other clothes and allow a swirly movement. It hit at about my ankles. My very short and tiny daughter also wore it successfully on her tiny, 5'1\\\\\" frame and it just touched the floor. So a good buy for the money."}

{"label":3,"review":"This is a fun and sexy little number but if your petite the top will be too big. I had to tie it in the back and couldn't use the snaps because it was huge. I'm a 32 band size. I'd guess it would fit a 36 well, MAYBE a 34. My husband still liked  it."}

I hadn't been able to find any 9 slims around our town or on many websites for that matterI was able to get him 2 pair of Levi 8-20 550 relaxed fit slip jeans and they were perfect.  The only thing better is if they had been bootcut but they were wide enough to go over his boots.  It would have also been nice to have the adjustable waist because they were just a tad loose but after a few washings I'm sure they will be fine."}

{"label":2,"review":"I own another Champion sports bra that I bought at a retail store and it fits a bit snug as a Small. So, after reading other reviews, I figured I'd order a Large to be on the super safe side. And, boy oh boy, was I in for a surprise when I actually tried to put this bra on! It fits just as tight as the small I have at home. My boobs were instantly squished into oblivion and the straps dug deep into my shoulders. It took all of my energy to try and then get the thing off without popping a shoulder out.<br \/><br \/>It says on the tag that it's medium support - yeiks, can't even imagine what &#34;maximum&#34; support would do to your rib cage - and recommended for activities like yoga, pilates, and walking. I would guess that's because you actually need to be able to expand your lungs for more strenuous athletic endeavors.<br \/><br \/>I would definitely categorize this bra as a &#34;lean&#34; large. As in, if you are a naturally slender person and are larger than your equally slender peers, this is a bra for you. If your regular bra size is above an &#34;A&#34;, then proceed at your own risk! Unless of course you've been dying to know what it would feel like to bind your breast and masquerade as a man in a victorian rom com.<br \/><br \/>PS. In all fairness, the color is quite pretty and your boobs will definitely stay in place (zero jiggle on my 36B cup)."}

{"label":1,"review":"If this was a size 6, then they must have meant a children's size 6.  I didn't expect too much given the very low price, I even expected it to be a bit snug, but not doll-sized.  The fabric was OK, it probably would have been fine with major ironing, but being cotton, the body of the skirt wouldn't have lasted.  They do advertise that it can be worn with a petticoat.  If you are expecting the lovely 50's flare shown in the picture, make sure you add a petticoat to your order."}

{"label":0,"review":"I don't know what size they sent me, but it's not nearly a DD, and it's not the least bit supportive.  So even in the right size this is not the bra for me.  I'm sending it back."}

{"label":4,"review":"This is a thick T. I would say double the thickness. I ordered a size larger and after a wash, it  fit perfectly"}
{"label":2,"review":"Overall this seems to be a nice product but, whereas my daughter wears a small in other sports bras, the small size of this one is extremely tight - it left deep marks on her body after wearing it for one game. And, of course since she wore it, I can't return it so I guess this purchase was a waste for me. My suggestion would be to order the next size up."}
{"label":3,"review":"I ordered this jacket for my boyfriend we both loved it. However I ordered a medium like his other Columbia jackets and he needed a large in this (possibly because it's a pull over. ) it was no big deal a local store swapped them for us. Over all a great jacket."}

{"label":2,"review":"this is a good quality trench and with the liner, it makes it more versatile than a plain trench, but I had a few reservations that almost made me return it. The color is the first. I was looking for a Taupe colored trench, which is what it looks like online, in reality, the color has a green tint to it, so it is more like a light olive than a taupe (and the green is more intense in the sun).  If you are trying to match this to wear over certain suits, keep this in mind.  Second is that with the liner, the trench is very stiff and bulky looking (the photo online is CLEARLY without the liner).  I've noticed over the past few uses that the stiffness loosens a bit as you are using.    Overall, its a good trench, but with an odd color and some unflattering stiffness.  I'm keeping it, because I had an urgent need for a light colored trench, but I'm continuing to keep my eye out for a true \\\\\"Taupe\\\\\" trench."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this for my boyfriend, and they were absolutely amazing. But then he washed them the wrong way and there wastes the money I spent. Even after I told him to read how to do it... (men!) After washing it the wrong way it lost its softness and became a little stiff. Oh well. WONDERFUL BOXERS THOUGH and nice color!"}

{"label":4,"review":"These cuff links are so clutch I almost couldn't believe how much better my life became after I purchased them. Before I bought these cuff links, I was 5'6&#34; and 125 lbs at 19 years old, horrible with women, with a sever acne problem. I heard from a friend of mine that wearing these cuff links would turn your life 180 degrees around, but I did not realize the magnitude of how much my life would change. When I opened my package, I was greeted with a beautiful, beaming golden light emanating from within the package. The cuff links were truly mesmerizing, and I immediately changed to proper attire to try them on. Upon fitting the cuff links to my attire, everything went black. I woke up disoriented, and felt extremely nauseous. I stumbled to my bathroom to splash some water on my face, only to realize that I was now 6'2&#34; and 180 lbs., and my acne had cleared. Fast forward 2 months later, I'm now the starting quarterback for my Division I college football team, as well as Student Body president. These cuff links literally changed my life. 10\/10 would purchase again."}
{"label":4,"review":"I was a little nervous about the fit because this came from China and I kept reading that products run small, but it fit well. I love this and the only thing that I didn't care for was the lining of the hood. Its cute and I like it, but it would have been better with some kind of cotton material...like flannel."}
{"label":4,"review":"This peacoat is perfect for California, where we don't need to dress for subzero weather but it gets chilly as heck. Other reviewers have mentioned that the fabric is on the thin side and is synthetic, which for our climate here is perfect since its lighter weight. The coat has lost the stiffness and coarseness associated with traditional peacoats to take on a body-conscious, slightly tapered at the waist fit that looks great on a thin to muscular man.  Other reviewers have mentioned that it's cut too tight under the arms and in the shoulders, but for a guy who's lean, this is the sculptured modern cut that is intended so that you don't look like a black bear in it. The length is perfect to show off a nice pair of jeans. Don't buy it if you live in Vermont unless you're wearing it late spring or early fall, but for those of us further south, it's a piece that's good for 3 seasons.[[ASIN:B005CMHSVA Kenneth Cole Reaction Men's Plush Peacoat]]  Plus I got it for 75% off, so its hard not to be thrilled with this coat."}

The sleeves are definitely long sleeve (they are pushed up in the photo) The shoulders are &#34;puffed&#34; not padded  the ruffles are more generous &#34;oodles of ruffles&#34; for lack of a better phrase, ruffles that would do a Victorian lady back in the day proud.<br \/><br \/>Let me say here and now that ruffles are in, and should be worn by those who &#34;get it&#34; you have to feel and own this look, I've read a couple of reviewers  say this top is costume- like. Well , you can wear this as a costume, however if you are into feminine fashions and have a decent size wardrobe, this is a blouse that you can find skirts, blazers, sweaters ect....  to wear this top with. This can work with pants as well, it's up to you, Think Phaedra Parks Housewives of Atlanta the last season and a couple of the tops she wore. also think  Downton  Abbey add a velveteen short jacket  and wear this to a luncheon or to church, it also comes in black<br \/>so if you need a traditional look for a funeral instead of a dress, this and black pants will work.<br \/>The blouse is 100% cotton has very pretty pearly buttons, I bought the medium it fit perfect. Even though not necessarily &#34;sheer&#34; I would only wear this with a white blouse or camisole. with the white top. Machine wash warm, no bleach, dry on low setting,low iron per Allegra K instructions on tag. If my review has helped, please click yes below, all reviewers appreciate feedback."}

London Fog has quality jackets, I had one fall jacket that I wore for 15 years, even for camping before it finally got a big rip.

Out of the box 36x34 was so tight I had to inhale to button the sides (6' 3&#34; 200#, so not really fat), so back they go.  This might be a fluke but to get the fit I want I might have to get 40x34 and then it just might be huge.

My posture has improved a 200%, and I haven't had a back pain in the past 6 years. Because my posture is better, I don't have the bulging tummy for working mostly 8 hours sitting in front of a computer. Everybody thinks I kill myself doing sit-ups ;-)    I also exercise (not a whole lot), but I jog on the treadmill 3 times a week, for an hour. For this exercise, I've been using the cinch model for the past 6 years, and it is also very effective for maintaining my posture (and also have a big sweat) while I run.    They are very durable. I take good care of washing them with mild soap, and hang-dry out of the sun. I have to buy new ones once a year (the cinch), and one almost every two years (the vest)."}

I ordered a navy blue, and a light grey, and the difference is like night and day. The navy blue one was was looser, longer, and softer that the light grey.

I feel the coat definitely protects from cold wind better than others I've tried. I like the design of the inner sleeves that it hugs your wrists so no wind goes up the sleeve to make your arms cold.<br \/><br \/>My only dislike about the coat really is the zipper.

He liked the fit and the design of the shirt and so he kept it but just be aware that the material is very thin, so if you like that it'll work for you.  My husband is more into the thicker material like Kenneth Cole or Van Heusen."}

{"label":4,"review":"Absolutely beautiful!!!  This outfit has the look of an expensive knit. It is very lightweight and could be used in all but extremely hot weather. It is the nicest outfit for a boy I have ever seen. Lower price on Amazon than in Nordstrom."}
{"label":4,"review":"This jacket may be listed as just a jacket but, I have been wearing it all winter as my winter coat. I live I WI. and we have had some cold weather. The fleece lining keeps me warm and the hood protects my head protected. The cut of the jacket is perfect for me. Longer just a jacket helps keep more of me covered."}
{"label":1,"review":"Uncomfortable and you can't tell from the picture but there is no lining or padding,  only lace over the cups."}
{"label":4,"review":"I cannot say anything bad about this pant.  It is comfortable, breaths well and dries relatively quickly.  They are durable and remain wrinkle-free even after rolled into a pack for the weekend.  I recommend this product to anyone wanting a great looking comfortable travel or outdoors pair of pants."}
{"label":4,"review":"perfect"}
{"label":4,"review":"I usually wear a US Large, but after reading other reviewers who stated to go up at least 1 size, I headed their advice.<br \/>Their US XL fits me perfect.  I'm 6'1&#34; 190lbs and have a athletic build.  This fits snugly, and I love the slight stretch of the spandex.<br \/>The only downside is the sleeves aren't long enough...by 3 inches....but I have long arms and roll the sleeves up anyway."}
{"label":4,"review":"My husband says they are,&#34;Awesome.&#34;  He enjoys that they are soft and keep his feet warm in the New England weather."}
{"label":4,"review":"I'm 5'6&#34; tall--not exactly a tall woman, but I've repeatedly had trouble with knee socks that barely reach the top of my calf, and fall down annoyingly.<br \/><br \/>These socks are a welcome improvement--easily long enough and, as a result, they don't fall down much either. I just wore them for the first time, so we'll see how they wash, but they're well-made, with nice texture and weight.<br \/><br \/>I'll be buying more of these in the future."}

{"label":4,"review":"1st of all I splurged and got the Real Rabbit Fur Ushanka instead from the same company as this one,(my Obama winter hat :P) It is super soft and warm as well and the quality is outstanding.<br \/>Im doing my review on my Rabbit fur ushanka but should apply to all ushanka even this one :)<br \/> Alot of people haveing issues with attaching the pin there's an easy way ill explain in a bit.<br \/>  here are things you should consider, Do make sure you measure your head perfectly as they have many sizes and you want something that will fit, if you are not sure or think it might be to tight go a size up or two  since inside the ushanka there are pull strings to make the inside smaller to fit perfect.<br \/> Being a Marine I thought of this as a military cover, so it supose to fit just perfect that I'm able shake my head and it will not come off. think of it a beanie that doest cover your ears.  the ushanka  has 2 parts.  1st you have the main crown, 2nd the ear flaps that go to the back. when flaps are folded up the crown shoud sit snuggly right above your ears. ushanka should not cover your ears when flaps are up.<br \/>as for the badge\/pin the fasteners are dull at the end. and is pretty much impossible to get them thru the front flap cover as it is thick, some people used combinations of fliers, pins, nails ect.<br \/> well duh just make the fasteners ends pointy with a metal file, knife sharpener or even just cement floor. the (Copper?) fasteners are easy to bend as well to file down to a sharp point and this make the whole attaching pin to ushanka soo easy! i used a metal file and took seconds to make it real sharp\/pointy<br \/> you are welcome."}

{"label":4,"review":"I loved these, but they run small.  I bought 2 pairs in a small and returned them for a medium.<br \/>Great for the summer months with a tee top to wear to the gym or shopping at the market,<br \/>etc.  They are running out of them though."}
{"label":4,"review":"It was hard to find a pair of footies that would not show near the toes or along the sides of my low-cut pumps, but these fit the bill. I wear them in the hot months down in Texas, and after a few hours they stretch a bit and tend to peek out just a little.  I bring along a 2nd pair, switch out, and I'm fine. Truly, these and one other brand (which I found on amazon) are the best, slimmest footies I could find."}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered two, a large for me an a small for a 'friend'. Very pleased with the quality, colors and fit. I would highly recommend."}
{"label":2,"review":"When they say &#34;runs big&#34;, they're not kidding.  It runs very big.  I like it because it allows me to layer when I walk during cold weather.  I love this jacket.  It's very stylish and comfortable.  I love the fleece inside."}
{"label":0,"review":"A costly error.  The skirt fits okay - the top is too small.  I ordered a 14 but the top is more like a small 12 or 10.  Too costly to return to England - $86.00 within the required time or $40.00 slow mail and would not have arrived within required time.  Beware of where returns are going to - this was direct to England, not to Amazon.  I am still trying to find someone that likes the suit and it fits!"}
{"label":4,"review":"My grandson just loved these pajamas."}
{"label":2,"review":"it arrived quickly, the size 12-18 Mnth fits on my 9 months baby girl. but the materials of the tutu look cheap\/ i don't highly recommend it."}
{"label":2,"review":"I love this shirt but I can't pick out my own size?"}
{"label":4,"review":"My son usually wears size 24 months.  I got this shirt in 2T and it was snug, but fit.  This shirt is absolutely adorable and we got so many compliments, but you may want to consider ordering a size up."}

{"label":3,"review":"Love this costume shirt! Sizes def run small, I'm usually an xsmall or small in adults and ordered a medium based on other reviews and it fits perfectly. Really glad I ordered a size up. Material is legit and pretty durable. All in all very happy with this item!"}
{"label":4,"review":"so festival and beautiful that this can dress up any outfit that you were very impressed, thanks a bunch and will gladly wear this"}

{"label":4,"review":"I bought these socks for my husband. He has large, flat feet and socks always fit him oddly. But with these dress socks he was pleasantly surprised on how soft and comfortable the socks are. They are lightweight for those you you who do not like padded socks. The colors of the socks are vibrant and eye appealing. They are very durable he washed them and they held up to their original condition. Overall theese are extremely durable dress socks to own!<br \/><br \/>*Disclaimer I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review."}

{"label":4,"review":"These do not run small. I'm 5'4&#34; 114lbs and size 5 fits as expected. They are light, comfortable, thin and do a great job of staying in place. My everyday go-to panty of choice."}

{"label":3,"review":"Nice and good price"}
{"label":4,"review":"This style is Perfect for the larger waisted guys. Very little shrinkage. Bought 3X for 320 lb guy who wears 44-46 waist pants. Just a tad big, but very comfortable at the waist band."}
{"label":3,"review":"It is adorable, but these shots are better when the baby is a newborn and it is way too big for my newborn. I will just do the picture when she is bigger. Very well made."}
{"label":0,"review":"I got a medium and its Way too small! It's doll size!"}
{"label":4,"review":"This keychain is perfect for the true \\\\\"shoe-aholic\\\\\", and that would be me!!I recently had my locks changed on my house and was putting keys together for my friends when I saw this keychain and said \\\\\"Perfect!!\\\\\".My friends would see the shoe and know that the key belongs to me.Everyone had a good laugh over it when I handed them my new key and agreed that it truely was the perfect keychain for me.It's a good size and very substantiable feeling.It doesn't feel cheap.I'll probably be ordering a few more."}
{"label":3,"review":"Beautiful dress and looks exactly as I thought it would. I'm in a 1940s USO show every year and I can't wait to wear this dress this year. It was a smaller in the shoulders\/bust than I expected. I would have ordered up a size, but then the waist would be too baggy (I'm more hourglass than apple). With the right support system under it I can make it work."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good"}
{"label":4,"review":"I chose this jacket to keep me dry and able to layer for some cooler temps on my upcoming vacation. The jacket arrived, on schedule, looking just like it did in the picture! I love the color! The quality looks amazing!"}
{"label":4,"review":"extremely comfortable"}
{"label":2,"review":"This is a nice looking belt.  I use belts though to hold up my pants so I tighten them down.  This belt has started to change shape and strectch after about 10 uses.  I would understand if a had tools or something hanging from it but that is not the case.  Just my pants.  Other Dickies belt have held up far better than this.  It seems to have a very nice looking fake leather front to the belt that is just not up to the job."}
{"label":4,"review":"bought it as a gift and was a hit!  good quality and good tshirt.  Came considerably quicker than posted on site which was perfect!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Great for a gift"}
{"label":0,"review":"Too large, too padded. A large full figure does not need padding.  My error, I ordered the wrong Bra."}
{"label":4,"review":"i love this brad and in my country we no have same this brand thank you very much they are so nice"}
{"label":4,"review":"very comfortable a flattering! If you have larger than a B cup, you need to wear your own bra in addition."}
{"label":3,"review":"Runs a bit smaller than expected but otherwise fits well and is super comfortable."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love this t-shirt! Looks great & fits just as expected. The transfers on the front and back of the shirt make it look as though they are real patches sewn on, they are even raised to FEEL like real patches. Can't wait to wear this to the Walker Stalker Con in a few weeks!"}
{"label":4,"review":"My husband mostly wears white shirts for work. I bought this shirt for him and he keeps rotating this shirt twice ot thrice in a week. He loves this shirt. He says fabric is rich and super soft, and most importantly it fits him perfect (the shirt is not trim fit but true to its size in normal regular cut shirt). I also like the fact that even after several washes, the fabric has not lost its whiteness and shine. This shirt, even though formal wear, looks awesome on blue jeans.  All in (including shipping) it costed $37. Highly recommend - The perfect white shirt."}
{"label":4,"review":"I purchased this set of socks for my daughter. She says they are much cuter than the picture shows and soft and comfy and warm. I am glad for the purchase because she loves to be warm and cozy in the cold weather. These will get lots of wear."}
{"label":3,"review":"the shirt is nice except the sizing is just a tad small other than that it's a nice shirt to have."}
{"label":3,"review":"Very nice scarf at great price. Came from China, but delivery took less time than expected. Will be great for 4th of July next year. I found it very odd that a religious cross was included as bonus in the packaging - only wanted the scarf."}
{"label":4,"review":"This was a gift, both she and I loved."}
{"label":4,"review":"I hate putting  my daughter in jeans that zip and button, these are so much more comfy for her.  They fit great and look good on.  Can the stupid skinny jean trend for kids please go away.  I love these so much, I bought gray ones too."}
{"label":3,"review":"It's as expected. since its a sword for a dance it is perfect for stage presence- if you have a child around 48&#34; it will seem too big - but for the price it's a good quality"}
{"label":3,"review":"The white color does not fit my skin color,  but I like the fit, calvin klein is a great fitting person, for men.  Its nice to know that there is a dresser out there to help men with there choices of clothers"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a very nice dress. The quality is very good and it is true to color, size and length. I will be buying again."}
{"label":3,"review":"These are the stockings you want to buy.  They fit.  That is a huge plus.  I think they look great.  We have had a lot of fun because of these stockings.  Heck they have led us back to Amazon for more.  I think this is a great deal."}
{"label":2,"review":"This bra was okay but not what I was looking for. I am sure it would be fine for the right person. Thanks."}
{"label":4,"review":"This scarf or &#34;fashion blanket&#34; as I like to call it is not only very cute but very soft. It looks and feels good on - what more could you ask for??"}
{"label":4,"review":"These are my kind of hats.  Love it!"}

{"label":3,"review":"Works okay on a 8&#34; augar hole but any larger may not any better.  Satisfied"}
{"label":4,"review":"Loved the sweater, but the x lg was too big.  I generally wear a cog but this was way way too big.  Generously cut.  Nice weight"}
{"label":4,"review":"Very pretty and extremely soft.  My husband wears 2XL and is plenty big - which he likes.  Would probably fit a 3x."}
{"label":1,"review":"Very disappointed in these leggings. They run snug, all the rest of my leggings are almost too large on me.  One wearing and the pilled as well. Not the quality I am used to."}
{"label":4,"review":"It came in and it was perfect, fit as expected. Fast shipping well made. Happy customer. 5\/5"}
{"label":4,"review":"The shoes completely fit ! I have a hard foot to fit, so I was especially pleased to find the right go-go boots to wear to my 60s party. They worked great all night."}
{"label":4,"review":"The fit was perfect and exactly what I needed. Note I did not use this for a dance outfit but rather to wear under a costume and it worked well. I would buy this again in another color and use it again. The price also is right for what I needed and I liked the folding by the waist - it was not too bulky which was an original concern of mine."}
{"label":0,"review":"I was disappointed with these shorts. I am normally a size 0-2 depending on the brand so I ordered the smallest size they had and it was a size 6. And, not to mention they're not nearly as nice as they look in the picture, the denim was very cheap. But hey, I guess you get what you paid for."}
{"label":4,"review":"just what I wanted. Thank you"}
{"label":3,"review":"Good value for the money.  Fit as advertised, color as shown."}
{"label":3,"review":"Great leisure bra. Definitely not for working out or extrenuous activity, but awesome for daily\/lounge wear. I am 38DD, but I got the Large instead of XL, and it fits great."}
{"label":4,"review":"i love this outfit,very sexy and cute! both the skirt and top are well-made,and the panties are fixable which means the back of the g-string moves to fit you perfectly. it is simply awesome!"}
{"label":0,"review":"The dress is WWWAAAYYY too small. A friend of mine got a medium and there's a HUGE difference in the sizes. The small looks more like an extra small--like a size 2 or size 0 dress. The medium was like a size 10 or 12. Seriously? Not recommended. The only good thing about is the fabric--quite smooth and stretchy, though it's not sewn together very well."}
{"label":3,"review":"more large"}
{"label":3,"review":"Love the dress, little big on the top but it can be fixed. Will order again."}
{"label":4,"review":"Beautiful product."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very happy with the quality of this Jacket."}
{"label":4,"review":"Everything about this tie set is perfect. Bought it as a christmas gift for my brother and father in law. The tie comes prepackaged in an elegant black box. The display is perfect. All I had to do was drop it in a gift bag! No need to wrap it because the presentation of the tie is already really nice. The colors are vibrant and identical to what you see on here! I am ordering 5 more tie sets from them again before the holiday arrives. Oh, and the shipping was super quick!"}
{"label":4,"review":"excellent"}
{"label":4,"review":"Feels good and looks nice"}
{"label":2,"review":"This pattern is very nice and the color is pretty. I have discovered that I am not a fan of the infinity loop."}
{"label":3,"review":"Comfortable, cute, my husband likes it. The chest is very low cut and wide set, and my chest is wide set anyway. But other than too low for work, it is great. The material is an odd silky shiny but very comfortable blend. It is just what I wanted and perfect for a quick, comfortable, summer dress. As always read seller reviews separate from product reviews - not the same."}
{"label":4,"review":"I love how these head coverings are made! They are so comfortable and easy to just slip on and they frame the face beautifully. I plan to wear it out to a really nice restaurant with a friend. This is my second purchase from this company and I plan to purchase many more of their products. I am very pleased so far with the products and the speedy delivery. The only con is they are a little overpriced."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very comfortable, good material"}
{"label":3,"review":"Nice quality but runs large"}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought this item as a gift for my daughter, a college student. She's thrilled with it. It fits well and is a great lighter-weight coat. The only thing negative about the item is that a couple of the buttons were loose. We cut the buttons off and re-stitched them."}
{"label":4,"review":"Fits good, just a little tight, but i have a bit big head."}
{"label":3,"review":"Bought this wig to be Wendy and it was perfect!  Wired braids and bright shiny color.  The only drawback is that it seems a bit small for one size fits all. I have thick hair so it just barely covered everything. I also bought a hair stocking with helped but the wig was definitely tight. I only had to wear it for one night and got lots of good comments so it was worth it :)"}
{"label":4,"review":"Love!!!!!! came quick"}
{"label":4,"review":"loved it"}
{"label":4,"review":"good pants"}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought a similar heavy sweatshirt from Carhartt locally to handle the cool mornings working in my shop, and originally thought my purchase of the Dakota product would serve as a backup (need two to rotate for cleaning becaue of sawdust, fiberglass, etc). Quite frankly this heavy sweatshirt is far superior to the much more expensive Carhartt one. It is warmer, more pliable\/flexible (v. the Carhartt &#34;quilted&#34; liner type), and the external fabric softer resulting in a much more comfortable fit. I will probably sell my Carhartt one and get a second one of these in a different color eventually. Highly recommended."}
{"label":1,"review":"Loved it until I washed it. Washed as instructed and looks 10 years old. Threads EVERYWHERE!!"}
{"label":4,"review":"good material and workmanship. once again Hathaway has met my expectations. i only wish we had more color options than blue and gray."}
{"label":0,"review":"Did not like it at all"}

{"label":3,"review":"I order mine in Feb 2015 and I have to say, this thing does it's job. I am 5.3, 126 lbs, 36-28-36, and 4 kids. I was going to order a small instead I ordered an XS. It is very tight!!!! I am able to go to the last and smallest hooks, however, I can't move comfortably. The only con I have with this is that the external material is very &#34;rubbery&#34;, like it was recycled from a tire. The lining underneath is comfortable but the external look isn't as flattering. It's long but does ride up with I sit down. Other than that it does what it says. I wouldn't advise on jogging in this, especially if you order it too small. I tried to and I almost passed out. lol."}
{"label":0,"review":"I have so many blouses and dresses that have a low-cut and so can't wear them. I thought it would be good.

{"label":4,"review":"I wear it when I ride my bike to work.  Temps are typically in the 40's and it does its job.  It's also very comfortable and as good a sweatshirt as any name brand."}
{"label":2,"review":"This pullover was advertised as 100% cotton. Not what I received!  It was 50% cotton and 50% polyester plus somewhat larger than normal.  I'm very disappointed! EB!"}

{"label":2,"review":"This loungewear set was nice quality but I ordered and XL for my daughter and it was definitely way too big. She still likes them but they are pretty large."}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought this as a night time shirt, and it feels fine. I am surprised at the size - it isn't as big as I expected\/wanted, but I don't usually shop in these large sizes, so that is my fault. It reaches mid-thigh (I am 5' 8&#34;) and is nice and comfortable."}
{"label":4,"review":"Exceeds expectations and the unique locking and release mechanism works better than expected. Look for the higher grade leathers to go with this buckle for a super sharp look."}
{"label":2,"review":"If you plan to use this shirt for layering, error towards a size smaller. She new this shirt tends to shed."}
{"label":4,"review":"I have not washed it yet. But so far, so good. The color is perfect, looks just like it appears on screen."}
{"label":1,"review":"Material felt cheap and plastic\/synthetic. Technically leather but doesn't feel like it. Went to Ross and bought a similar wallet (Tommy Hilfiger as well) with authentic leather feel for only $10."}

{"label":3,"review":"Very nice gloves, but as it turns out they are too small, which came as a huge disappointment as they are beautiful glove, soft supple leather and warm in cold weather. But I could barely wear them they were so tight. My hands are large but an X-Large always fits. these were very tight and very hard to put on. More like a large than a X-large.<br \/><br \/>But they fit my father beautifully and he loves them so he got an extra Christmas gift this year. He needed a new pair anyway as it turned out. But the smart touch feature is lost on him."}

They were such nice quality and fit him better than any of his other shorts that he bought them. He loved them so much he asked me to go online to see if I could find them in another color. So happy I found these shorts on Amazon...and still at a great price! He purchased three more pairs for less than $60 (what he usually spends on one pair of shorts) and these things are awesome - great quality, a nice variety of color choices, very comfortable, and perfect for warm weather!"}

{"label":2,"review":"Received this sweatshirt and was very surprised to see the words 'SAUCE HOCKEY EST. 2009 DESIGNER CLOTHING FOR THE PERFECT HOCKEY SWAGGER' written over the back of the sweatshirt.  Since the back of the sweatshirt was not shown, and no where did it list this in the description, you have no idea it is there until you receive it.  I'll be sending it back.  If you don't mind that, the quality appears to be good."}

{"label":3,"review":"This is a thick latex mask.  Should you choose to wear one, it will be hot, it will be disorienting, visibility will be quite diminished, and a tad clausterphobic; but, the mask is a great look and is great homage to classic horror flicks.  Also, be ready to stuff the mask with wads of newspaper or something of the like as it will arrive in a large flat envelope and will be quite flat.  Allow a couple of days to restore shape, otherwise, your look of Mr. Lagosi will look something more of the Elephant man.  Good Luck!"}
{"label":4,"review":"The shirt fit is a little bit big for medium but that is usually the case with brand new clothing items. But the shirt is very comfortable and has a really nice black mat to it. I would definately recommend these tees to anyone and amazon is a great place to find items that you cant find in retail stores. I looked high and low for these tees and finally decided to go online and as usual amazon has come through again."}

{"label":4,"review":"I ordered this in a large (I'm 5'7&#34; about 140 pounds), and it fit well. It's pretty short but I wore it with fishnets and garter no problem. It's also see through in the back white part (there is a little tail attached as well) so I wore a short white dress under it. I like that it came with the snake and the gloves are awesome too because you can still use your hands all night. People loved this one! Came fast too."}

{"label":2,"review":"Bottoms are too small"}
{"label":3,"review":"I like these.  The fabric blend his pretty good.  It hugs the skin even though it is mainly made up of cotton.  The design is nice and the color is spot on.  The only thing I don't like is that the front logo is not very flattering.<br \/><br \/>Overall a good buy."}
{"label":2,"review":"The quality is not as good as I thought. Generally speaking, it's okay after all it's cheap."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very warm"}
{"label":4,"review":"I love the color of this dress. It's sooo comfy. Am wearing it right now.<br \/>would actually buy it in different colors."}
{"label":2,"review":"I am average size (8-ish), and these were too big. Even flipping the clips over, there was a significant gap. The fabric (unwashed) is sturdy and kind of stiff, so it looks funny under thin tops. The clips (a plastic hook with a silicone snap-like thing) rubbed uncomfortably and didn't stay clipped. They are also very narrow and only fit around very thin bra straps. This product would be greatly improved if it used elastic and snaps with several position options like the As Seen On TV kind, which are much more comfortable and adjustable. In order to use this product I am going to have to cut them down and attach elastic and snaps. I haven't decided yet if that would be worth the trouble."}
{"label":3,"review":"Now, I'm no expert on children's pajamas, so forgive me if there's some weird reason why they should be snug, but it seems like the tops are a bit smaller than usual. They fit fine, and the fabric is pretty stretchy, but 4T clothing I've purchased for my sisters has tended to run a bit larger.<br \/>If your child is in between sizes, I'd definitely suggest going with the larger size."}

{"label":3,"review":"The fit was as intended so that was great. All the dimensions were great. I would say the only con would've been the smell. It kindof smelled like fish. I just let it air out next to my window for a couple days though. All good!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Ok"}
{"label":3,"review":"Order 44x30 but measure at waist of the pants is actually 45 inches from button to the buttonhole. The fabric looks tough and I am sure it will last so long, the hammer loop came with one side sewed inside out but I don't mind that. The color &#34;bark&#34; is greenish brown and is darker than the sample picture."}

{"label":4,"review":"Hesitated greatly on buying gloves sight unseen and without trying them on.  These fit AMAZING from the fingers\/hand\/arm\/and above; they go up over the elbow and how enough stretch material in them not to sag down.  The black satin is thick and rich and luscious and black as black as I had hoped all this and for $12.95? WOW AND WOW!  Product came very quick and great safe undamaged packaging.  I'm excited to get a couple of different colors so many many to choose from which in itself is awesome!"}

{"label":2,"review":"It doesn't look much like the picture. There's not nearly as much volume, the hair is a little thin. I ordered it to use for a Nora Valkyrie (RWBY) cosplay and it works for my purposes but for the money I spent, I expected a lot better. Not my best buy."}

{"label":2,"review":"Love design but sizing was less than accurate. As a male nurse with little options for scrub wear that is not monochromatic and simply bland, this was purchased for wear as a scrub top that would provide mild visual stimulation for the patients. Looks good but tight across the chest. Hope it doesn't shrink in the wash."}

{"label":3,"review":"Nice dress for a low price!"}
{"label":4,"review":"my husband loves it"}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice!"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a very pretty dress. It's too dark to be cool enough to wear in the summer sun, but the cut-out pattern on the bottom helps and looks nice. A lot of Sakkas clothing has huge arm holes that are too revealing or that you have to wear something else underneath, but this dress is not like that, thankfully. Fits well, but if you're larger than a size 8, go up."}
{"label":3,"review":"Light weight and great for special occasions. The price was perfect as well, and it was on prime. Worth the $$."}
{"label":0,"review":"Although I thought that this item was very beautiful, it was bad quality. My wife had not even used it for a week when it broke. All of the beads scattered, and it was impossible to put back together. The 6 dollars that I put into this product was a total waste. I will not be buying from this seller again."}

{"label":3,"review":"My Dress arrived today. It is Beautiful! Very well made, came with a beaded chiffon wrap that matches dress and extra beads.  After reading all the reviews, I used the measuring chart and did order 2 sizes up. At 5.9, it is a good floor length dress. I love the fit of the dress, Although it is a close fitted style in the bodice. Everything zipped up without tugging. I plan to wear a 3\/4 length Satin Bolero Jacket with it.  I have several months before my son's wedding. Looking forward to wearing this dress."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this dress for my 16 yo daughter and she loves it! its fits well and she has no complaints"}
{"label":3,"review":"The size is too small but the quality of wool is great."}
{"label":4,"review":"These are very warm and fit great, so that was great! The only downside is that the bottom couple of inches, right above the ankle, are very tight elastic; so tight, in fact, that I end up with pressure patterns pressed into he skin above my ankles when I take them off. Over all, though, a great product - crucial for dealing with the subzero (Fahrenheit) temperatures we've been experiencing recently."}
{"label":4,"review":"Was a little disgruntled that this would not be a Prime item but it got here in about a day and a half. A little pricey (about double what I usually pay from Target) but very high quality and also very unique. Wanted the green\/pink ones but they don't manufacture them anymore."}

We emailed customer service to let them know the problem, they responded quickly and were very helpful.

{"label":4,"review":"Love it"}
{"label":4,"review":"Fit is perfect. I was expecting this to be of high end Halloween costume quality, and I was blown away. I've spent a lot of time studying production stills, original costume drawings and photos of the actual costume. I would honestly say that aside from the red portion being a faux leather instead of a tactical fabric, this thing is screen ready. The quality of the stitching is amazing and the lining is comfortable and breathable, even for a faux leather garment. Definitely worth every penny I paid for it and then some. Not to mention the company I bought from got it to me from Karachi, Pakistan in only 10 days, not the month and a half Amazon originally quoted!"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is one of the most unique dressed i was able to find to prepare for our upcoming Holiday photos this year.  The way the sash weaves through<br \/>the smocking is such as great touch.  The silk is so beautiful in person, especially in the sunlight--It shimmers beautifully.  I just love all the details included--the interior linking, tulle skirt and cute fabric buttons."}

{"label":4,"review":"love it."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this backpack recently for my daughter, she loves this one over all the backpacks we bought for her, of course because of the detachable Minnie mouse, the size of the backpack is suitable for kids up to 5 years i believe , the materials of both the bag and the plush are very good"}

{"label":4,"review":"Ok, so I ordered 5 (yes) other sequin dresses from Amazon for my 40th birthday and this is the only one that looks classy. I'm 5', 106 lbs and it fits perfectly. Fitted with give and space so it doesn't look skin tight. It has a full &#34;dress&#34; inside as the lining so no need for a slip. The top sheath is a netted bit that has the sequin\/beadvwork. The design on the full back of the dress covers up anything so you can wear your comfy granny panties, np. The braided trim at the top is FANTASTIC. It is really metal chain, not fabric!  It glams it up from your mama's sequin get up. So re-wearable for a NYE party! I ordered the purple and it's a lovely dark, eggplant shade. The chain matches really well too. I did have to trim a few hanging threads, but no biggie. Go for it, worth the extra fee bucks compared to the other sequin dresses available. The other dresses look like cheap mall dresses, this looks boutique for sure!"}

{"label":4,"review":"LOVE LOVE LOVE these pants! I have them in 4 different colors. They look great and really hug my body. I bought a similar pair from another company that had an elastic low waist and they fit horrible. Sakkas high waisted pants are, by far, my favorite. Will definitely be purchasing them in more colors!<br \/>I am a size 0 and the small fit me fine. They are very stretchy so I imagine a small can fit up to a 6. They were a bit loose in my ankle area but I have tiny ankles. It didn't detract from the look though. Fit is same as model which is nice. I'm tired of purchasing small clothes from sellers and having it fit like a large or medium =\/"}

{"label":3,"review":"Very warm jacket. As another reviewer mentioned the sizes are off you might want to check the sizes at Nautica's website, We bought a large which was 7. It seemed kind of small for a 7, smaller than my zon's other size 6 jackets. Maybe its the style, but I would order a full size up. Nice price for a brand jacket. My son likes it."}
{"label":3,"review":"after a couple washes they stretch.....maybe i'm doing something wrong"}
{"label":4,"review":"Great product, especially for a fan of the team.  Plenty of spaces for those of us with an extensive card collection.  More than enough space for money and receipts.  The leather has not shown any signs of poor construction as others have early in my past wallets.<br \/><br \/>I went with this version rather than the companies other model due to the slot for ones drivers license.  The other model had the insert you could remove for license only.  This one it is a part of the wallet, no chance of losing it.  I can easily fit a few of my sports licenses behind the drivers license window for those of us who fish\/hunt.<br \/><br \/>I often carry a collection of business cards and charge cards on me.  No problem having them all in the wallet."}
{"label":3,"review":"Used it for a Halloween costume birthday party! Very happy with the mask! Worth the purchase! Thank you very much!"}

He wrote to me to ensure that xxl size would fit me well.  The color and loose style both are perfect and material is also pretty and breathable and at the same time not see through.  Thank you for considering all customers needs."}
{"label":4,"review":"It's hard show ties online, so it's always kind of dicey buying them.  This one is much nicer than pictured.  Has a nice hand, substantial fabric but not bulky, and has a nice satin sheen to it.  Looks great with a gold\/yellow shirt."}

{"label":4,"review":"Received the package in time, no problems. Great bonus included by the way))  The dress is pretty good for a wedding party, as it's white, the colour is very pleasant, doesn't look cheap or \\\\\"just white\\\\\". If the skin is tanned it's great. Also, as the dress is white, it's good to wear it with coloured shoes.  I bought the S size, and it fits me well,a bit small under my armpits but it's not a problem, the button in the end of the zipper is fixed not very good, and it fell off, but again - that is not a problem if you can handle a needle and a thread)  The only thing i won't use definitely are the detachable straps, and that's why - in my opinion, if they were closer to the shoulders, that would have been very nice, but when attached they are closer to your neck and the space down from the chin to where the dress itself begins appears quite small and the whole thing looks like an apron really...  Without the straps the dress is just gorgeous!  I like this dress very much, is funny and beautiful and quite comfortable to wear, and I'm not disappointed and look forward to wear it for my wedding day))!"}

I have found that some of the high end bow ties i purchased in London (around $80~90) aren't even made with this nice material. It has a simple neck adjustment and forms into a very nice bow due to the texture and density of the fabric, allowing it to hold its shape; it does not slip around like silk ties, where I find my self having to adjust every so often. Overall, I think these Sheridan Man Made ties are quite the steal. I highly recommend them and I will definitely be getting more."}

{"label":4,"review":"[[VIDEOID:mo5CT2D1XD100L]]I do love these little dirt bike pajamas and almost every little guy I know adores reading about dirt bikes, motorcycles, and dreams about riding them.  The pajama top has lone raised rubberized design that is very cool.  This are the perfect pjs for the bike lover. The bottom is eye-popping and very busy with a swirl of dirt bikes and motorcycles.<br \/><br \/>Everything is well-made and stitched.  I did have to clip off a few threads, but nothing out of line here.  The pajamas have a rounded collar and are 100% knitted cotton.  They are snug-fitting and are machine washable.  The tagless label is an excellent choice for the youngster that finds them scratchy or uncomfortable.<br \/><br \/>As far as size goes, you'll have to think about that a bit.  If I find something a bit iffy, I'll move to the next size up.  I know whenever I bought pajamas for my son, but the end of the winter he could hardly squeeze into them.  These are snug-fit, but you don't want them so tight a child can't breath.<br \/><br \/>I do have a size 7T which should fit any youngster 32\\\\\" to 34\\\\\" tall who weighs between 47 and 53 pounds or so.  Keep in mind these are a snug fit.  I wouldn't recommend buying several sizes up, but these do run a bit on the smallish side and are a slim fit so I'd definitely go up at least one size.<br \/><br \/>Sample provided for review."}
{"label":2,"review":"I was so happy with quality of top in beginning, I loved the length, love the fit. But, after 4 washes, the top looks like a rags. The fabric has become very linty, and does not have the same body it did--after only four washes. I fear if I use lint shaver, it will wear out fabric, as fabric is already thin. Very disappointed with quality. For house wear, the top is acceptable, but not for the purpose it was purchased. It has become a sloppy house shirt, fit for dish washing and house cleaning."}

{"label":3,"review":"I ordered the Octavius from the My Smoking Jacket website and it is the same listing\/price as is on Amazon. When ordering, you are given the impression that this product, while not bespoke or made-to-fit, is in someway being \\\\\"customized\\\\\". For example, the placement of the tie-belt at your waist or below and for me, my sleeve length was between the medium and large and on ordering was told that they would reduce the large by one-half inch to accommodate. I also asked to have the breast pocket removed completely, butw was talked out of doing that. Sounded good, but it's really more \\\\\"marketing-hype\\\\\" than reality. When my smoking jacket arrived, it was very well packaged and the \\\\\"presentation\\\\\" is superb. I can't recall ever receiving any article of clothing where the \\\\\"unpacking\\\\\" was so spectacular. The jacket itself is in a cloth sleeve, buttoned closed and embroidered with the logo \\\\\"Duke and Digham\\\\\". The logo is also on the box top and not sure about the connection or relationship. I was also surprised upon taking the jacket out was how deeply creased it was and seems indicative that it had been in the box quite sometime. Hmm, I wondered how could that be given it was being \\\\\"customized\\\\\"? I tried it on and sure enough, it was on the \\\\\"large\\\\\" size. Took some measurements and indeed it was the \\\\\"large\\\\\" without any \\\\\"customizing\\\\\". It still fits and will work and it is a very nice smoking jacket. They did spend a good deal of time asking about measurements, which was important to me because the medium would have been too small. To that, I think the seller did a very good job making sure that the jacket was the right size, I just wish they would give up on the \\\\\"marketing-hype\\\\\" because they are not doing customizing at all. If you are thinking about buying one of these smoking jackets, I would also recommend you shop around because this seller is also offering many of the same jackets on eBay for a much lower price. This version (Octavius) is available on eBay for $124.99 and Iwish I had checked before ordering. I also saw the Horatio, Thaddeus, and several others at the greatly reduced price. If you are looking for a smoking jacket, this is definitely one you should consider just be sure to get the \\\\\"best deal\\\\\" before making your purchase and don't buy into the \\\\\"hype\\\\\" that you are getting it \\\\\"customized\\\\\" rather it's on off-the-rack purchase but the measurements provided are reliable."}

They smell better after a long day than my old running socks from Asics.<br \/>-Very comfortable. I like how the toe seam is not on your toes but just above them. That really bumps up the comfort level a notch.<br \/>-Easy to put on. Easier than most tight fitting socks.<br \/><br \/>Bad<br \/>-Socks are cut a bit higher than in the picture, the tops of mine sit right on side of my ankle and get pushed down because of it.<br \/><br \/>Ugly<br \/>-Socks are almost falling apart after ONE DAY of use! The fabric along all of my toes is already heavily chafed, and I only walked ~4 miles that whole day. These are definitely not good socks for all-day runs! Another day and I'm sure my big toe will break through it.<br \/><br \/>I hope they fix the material their socks are made of, or reinforce it somehow, because I'd like to continue purchasing their socks.

It was a somewhat pointy, boob-pointing-downward shape. As if it wasn't supporting and was giving no lift, despite adjusting the straps. I remembered reading somewhere that sometimes this shape happens when the cup is too small, so after analyzing a few more things about the fit, decided to return it and try a 28HH.<br \/><br \/>Verdict: 28HH is perfect! I felt the cup ran small, so would suggest buying your typical size and another one with a cup up if you can and return the non-favorite. Haven't found any issues with the ribbon creating and ill fit or showing up through clothes. The clasp area seems pretty itchy\/scratchy, but hoping this will soften with subsequent washes.<br \/><br \/>Since this is a discontinued style, you may be able to find a panty to match either in your collection or in a random store as it just so happened to match one I already had.

Sure they were still a little large, but not bulky. The sleeves were not too long, and the footie part fit her feet with no issue (the most important part, in my opinion). She LOVES these pajamas. The owls on the feet have little ears that stick up, and the bottom part of the feet that cannot be seen in the photo has cute grippy hearts. My niece stayed cozy and warm in these pajamas, yet did not seem to overheat at any part of the night or morning. She will probably comfortably fit in these PJs for 2 more years. If she requests more footie pajamas, I will look for the &#34;Komar Kids&#34; brand."}

I'm 105lbs, 32&#34; hips, and little backside.  I couldn't even put the smalls on bc they literally were the size of my 5 year old nieces panties.  lol yeah I compared them.  so I exchanged for the medium, and that's a much better fit.  still kind of small, but a large would be too much.  oh, if you have some junk in the trunk- forget about these.  they barely cover mine!  otherwise.. awesome buy."}

I already have a visor organizer for cards and a pen and such, but the miscellaneous junk was just getting annoying.<br \/><br \/>This does what it says, but there's nothing that really stands out about being great.  The side cupholders are annoying since they don't hold their shape so using them for anything other than a cup can be a pain.  The rest of the compartments suffer a similar problem, just no real shape to them until you put something in them.  I would've preferred something a little more rigid as far as the storage spots went.  And the larger parts don't have a full divider in them, so using them for smaller things, you may end having put something on one side and having to dig it up out of the other.<br \/><br \/>But for the price, it does function.  Easy to flip around the back of the seat, and not intrusive when you have it on the front of the passenger seat.  I would've only given it a three star rating, but the price is low enough that while \\\\\"you get what you pay for\\\\\", it's certainly more usable than some of the others I've seen in this price range."}

{"label":4,"review":"The fit and finish of this underwear is comparable to and in many cases surpases any fashion name brand underwear on the market. If you like a little tighter feel go a size smaller. They still have lots of give and stretch. I am a waist 31 and went with the small. It hugs me snug everywhere and keeps everything in place.<br \/>It is the sporty designs, the perfect fit and the great price that attracted me to the Croota line of underwear. I will definitely buy more...lots more!"}

The only odd thing about this brand of socks is the designs on them aren't mirror images so one foot the design is on the outside of the leg and the other foot the design is on the inside of the leg."}

{"label":3,"review":"We bought 3 of these for my daughters wedding.  I would have given them 5 stars if I did not have to alter them.  The dresses fit everywhere except the bust was a little big.  The top mid front wouldn't lay flat against the body. I had to alter all 3 of them at the breast seams to take them in a little. The dresses come with spagetti straps that can be sewn in and a matching shawl. They are well made and they were very flattering even on full figured ladies.  The dress is fully lined which is nice.  The fabric is very nice, has a slight sheen, not too thin, doesn't wrinkle easily. The top holds it's shape because it has boning sewn in on both the side and bust seams which is nice. All three ladies were very happy with these dresses and recieved many compliments."}

I am not one for hats or scarves but due to asthma in the cold I have to wear something on my face when it is cold and windy. Ours just arrived today and let me tell you..yes a little hot but that is what you want to be nice and toasty. It is not like you are wearing it for hours and hours. I can't wait for some cold snowy weather to try out this item. It is what they advertise so if you are looking for just plain old fleece then don't bother but anyone that is out there snowblowing and the wind and snow blowing in your face this is the hat you want. I love the beanie style and that it covers my ears and hey if you get it and don't like it then use it as a bag as shown on the card that comes with it...have fun...let it snow..."}

{"label":4,"review":"The sweatshirt we ordered for my 3 year old son for Christmas was too small, so we exchanged it for this one.  I'm so glad that we did!  Not only is it cuter than the other other Superman sweatshirt, it also fits much better.  My son absolutely loves it and refuses it to take it off.  It's super soft inside too.  My son typically wears 4T tops, but i got a 5\/6.  It's a little big, but he'll be able to grow into it.  Which is good, because I don't think this sweatshirt is going to be off his body for a long, long time.  If you have a little Superman fan like I do, then I highly recommend this sweatshirt."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love these tops! I usually wear a Medium but these I bought in a small because it was still a little too baggy. These are super soft and very comfortable where it shows off your figure but not too tight, I also love how many different colors they have.

It wasn't even out of the box and I knew it was one of the worst purchases I have ever made. I would never even think of wearing this thing in public. The description made no mention that it was hard plastic like woven material. The obvious spray painted coloring of it was even worse.  I tried to unload it for $5.00 at our local second hand clothing shop in town and they wouldn't even buy it from me. They said to \\\\\"hang onto it until Halloween and MAYBE they would buy it then\\\\\".  Just goes to show how horrible this hat is. It wasn't worth returning because I wouldn't have been reimbursed for what I paid for it plus the shipping and handling charges.  I did not mean to rate this product a star.  It cannot by any means be rated!!"}

The plastic flap for protecting carbon copies does not cover the required spaces where writing occurs.  However nice the grain may look, please take note of the stitching.  This is, at best, a fair product, and your money is better spent elsewhere."}

{"label":4,"review":"I had just about given up trying to find a jacket like this in our local stores.  The pictures and the description here on the Amazon site gave me a pretty good indication that this is what I'd been looking for, but knowing how sizes can vary dramatically on an item like this, and not being an expert or particularly familiar with the Perry Ellis line, I was very concerned about ordering online and not being able to try the jacket on first. But when I saw the review by a gentleman who sounded like he was the exact same size as me (6'1\\\\\" 225 lbs with slightly longer than average arms), and since he was so happy with his XL order, I took a chance and ordered the same size.  In addition, the free return shipping offered on my order gave me an extra level of confidence.  I was not disappointed.  The jacket arrived the next evening and I could not have found a nicer fit even if I had been able to try it on first.  I was so relieved!  I really like the versatile styling of this jacket.  It will work perfectly for dressier occasions or casual with jeans and a t-shirt.  Today I wore it to work with gray dress slacks, an oxford shirt, and a lightweight fleece pullover since our temperature this morning was in the teens.  Great fit and comfort!  The photos don't show the lining, and I do wish they would, but mine is a very nicely quilted 3M Thinsulate material in a conservative yet handsome dark green and black glen plaid.  And of course the lamb skin is very luxurious, soft and touchable.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase!"}

I have it in pink, biege, gray, black and marine blue.  These bras provide an uplifted appearance which I prefer to the rounded cup bras.  My bras in this style have lasted over 2 years!   But just recently the sides on the Blue one became mushy like the rubber in the fabric melted - not sure how else to describe it - and the blue rubbery color was stuck on my skin under the arm and along the sides.  Only the Marine Blue had this problem.  I scrubbed and scrubbed and the blue color would not come off my skin.  It did come off overnight though.  Sadly, I had to throw the blue one away, but just bought another one to replace it today ."}

It comes to lower calf, about 2 &#34; above my ankle at longest point of skirt.  The top is slightly tight with a Gennie bra on, but can be very moderately loosened by the front ties.  The back ties barely have enough to tie up.  I do wish there was more tie, but not enough to downgrade the stars.  I am very happy with this purchase.  Note: Most clothing bought new (even at Wal-Mart) are treated in varying strengths of a solution of formaldehyde. This protects the cloth from bugs and slows  I recommend that you Always wash a product you are keeping before daily wear.  This dress may have an odor to it, and may take one to a few washings.

{"label":3,"review":"Love this costume! It was cheap, looked nice, and fit well. Size small costumes are usually too large on me, but this small fit great. The only problem, which is kind of major, is that the right sleeve was sewed on backwards! The hanging sleeve didn't fall to show the red sleeve, but covered it because the opening was facing the back. I cut the sleeve off and sewed it on correctly. I shouldn't have had to do that, but I did an adequate enough job to wear it to a costume party."}

If you combine this case with a screen film, your iPhone will be reasonably well protected during ordinary daily use, without the bulk of most other cases.  For me this is the ideal case."}

It came out smelling much better but the lace had numerous &#34;strings&#34; hanging all down both arms!! And one of the arms had a seam that was not sewn completely, so therefore (being lace) it looked like a gigantic hole when you put it on. So, now in addition to it having to be washed, I now have to mend it as well. So, just be cautious about washing and drying."}

I read other reviews to make sure to get your exact size because if it's too small it'll bunch all of your skin up at the top and if it's too big it'll roll down. I haven't had either of those problems so maybe I did pick the right size and it just doesn't work for me?"}

I'm a 'big girl' and I love that, unlike most plus-size pants, these do NOT come up to my armpits in the front!  They actually come to my waist.  And really, therein lies the only problem I have with these - the back, the bottom, the part that covers my behind, is a little too low.  I felt like I was flashing my undies to everyone all night!  I know I wasn't, but it took a while to get used to the feel.  Over all, great fit, nice sturdy feeling pants, good pockets, good look."}

Nevertheless, it  looked like if I had my correct size it would be beautiful and do the job :)<br \/><br \/>I ordered 2 of these in 2 different sizes, and based my order on what the item showed was in stock.  One black, one white, 2 sizes.  Well, the black was not in stock. Fine.  The white was delivered and it is too large, so I called customer service \\\\\"You have reached customer service and no one is available.  Thank you for calling.\\\\\"  CLICK.  Uh, no.  That doesn't work for me.<br \/><br \/>So I called sales, and the woman told me that they do not stock this product and she does not know what Valmont has on hand, so she could not tell me if it was going to be available if I re-ordered.<br \/><br \/>Needless to say, the bra is going back (it is too big so it would have gone back anyway) and I am NOT going to attempt a re-order. I had also ordered a different style that was \\\\\"in stock\\\\\" and was not delivered.<br \/><br \/>I expect stock status to be correct on all items that a vendor represents on Amazon.  Otherwise it is simply false advertising.<br \/><br \/>I won't purchase from this vendor again.<br \/><br \/>One more note: I contacted them via Amazon's contact seller procedure before calling them.  It appeared that they didn't even read my messages but just gave me a standard canned reply.  Most irritating.  I do all of my shopping online and this company loses. :("}

{"label":4,"review":"This is dress is soooo amazing! It really can be transformed in so many different ways and look beautiful in each configuration. I am a size 8\/10 and the dress size is perfect. There's definitely a little more room for women of larger dress sizes and if you're much thinner you can just wrap the straps around your waist a lot tighter to make it fit. One thing I'll say though is that this is NOT FOR BUSTY GIRLS! It definitely works out a lot better for small chested gals like me because I can just buy an adhesive bra and call it a day. This dress doesn't leave any room for proper support up top so my girls who are more blessed in the upper regions will have a hard time keeping those puppies supported. The material is heavenly! It's thick enough so you don't have to worry about anything showing and it also doesn't wrinkle much at all. The length isn't too bad either in my opinion. Im 5' 4 and it barely brushes the ground if I wear 4 inch heels. So if you are a very tall girl and planned on wearing hells then this dress might be too short for you. Overall I am thrilled that I was able to find a reasonably priced, versatile and pretty dress that is flattering on me since I have fuller figure. After ordering it in &#34;royal blue&#34; I ended up also getting it another color because I loved it so much!"}

{"label":3,"review":"Colors are exactly as pictured.  It has a half elastic band in the back with a side zipper enclosure.  Which is great because the solid waist band in the front gives you that sleek look and extra breathing room in the back with the elastic.  However, the one size is more like a small and the elastic band makes it also fit a medium(US size 10 is my guesstimate).  I am a size 12\/14 and I prefer more baggy than tight.  Definitely wishful thinking on my part.  Sadly returning but may purchase again if my abs ever return."}

{"label":2,"review":"I got tired of the Sears, Macy's, and Dockers braided belts breaking on me after 2 to 10 months of use, so I bought this belt.  Unlike the others mentioned, this is a true woven braided belt with no center material that the braids are woven around.    The belt is very nice looking.  They recommend one size bigger than your pant size.  I'm 32, so I got a 34 belt size.  I'm finding this size too big even before I tighten the belt.    The bad news is the whole belt stretches as you tighten it, which means I can never get it tight enough.  I will always have 6 inches or more of extra belt sticking out of the buckle.  I find myself constantly trying to tighten it and or pulling my pants back up.    Update:  Noticing the individual braids are starting to stretch.  Since the belt has no holes for the buckle to grab onto, it's secured by the braids.    New update 9\/28\/14:  I'm giving the belt an additional star since it survived over a year now and I wear it everyday.  It still stretches when I tighten it and the dye is coming off of the wear areas near the buckle, but none of the leather braids has broken.  I could never have gotten that life span out of the other belts mentioned above.  Other than the wear area near the buckle, the belt still looks nice."}

So did I, until I wore them the first time and realized I had no pockets. Yep, no pockets cost them a full star each. Even one of those pretender pockets as are often found tucked along the inner waistband of many mens' swim trunks would have left 4 stars for these pants.<br \/><br \/>FYI, I checked out mens' similar pants (full leg compared to this in a full leg), and guess what? They ALL have POCKETS. Guess I'll have to buy menswear when I need full length leg."}

I wish I would have ordered a xs instead."}

{"label":2,"review":"I'm 5'9&#34; and about 120 pounds - generally wear a 2, so I thought a small would be just fine. I ordered this top in the plum color in a size small, and was a little surprised at just HOW small it is, and also how sheer the top is. I tried it on with a pair of leggings I own that have a wide, striped waistband, and you could totally see the stripes on the waistband through the top (and the plum is a dark color!). The band around the bottom was pretty snug, and the arm bands were VERY snug. Also, the tag says &#34;Casa Lee,&#34; and I noticed other reviewers complaining of similar issues (too sheer, too small) after receiving a top with that label instead of LeggingsQueen. All in all, it's not awful, but it's a disappointment in light of the other raving reviews and what I was expecting because of them. I'm going to return it, order the same size in another color, and cross my fingers I get the real thing from LeggingsQueen as opposed to the other manufacturer."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great product for the price.<br \/>When I first pulled this dress out of the envelope I thought it was a sleeve...I'm a size 16 and 38C so when I saw it I couldn't understand what it was... but let me tell you that it stretches just fine! I think this would fit up to a size 18 or maybe 20."}
{"label":0,"review":"The price is good and I like the fit..but..after only 3 times wearing it, the thread is already coming out from the waist band. There are 3 rows of thread, so I still have 2 left. I don't expect them to last long.  UPDATE... after one month, the side seams are coming apart. DO NOT BUY!!! These shorts are cheaply made. It is a waste of money!"}

I normally wear a large, which is what I ordered, it's tight everywhere. Definitely order a size (at least) larger than what you would normally wear."}
{"label":4,"review":"Keeps me warm and actually keeps me a bit cool on a sunny day too...<br \/><br \/>I've been doing some longer runs with this shirt and none of the seams chafe.  The neckline is very comfy and so far it's durable.<br \/><br \/>It now has a slight pinknish tinge due to a washing machine mishap.

We have a hot tub at home and live in the mountains, this suit will also come in handy for the hot tub and cooler weather."}

{"label":3,"review":"I thought I'd take the chance and buy something that had no reviews. It took about 15 days to ship from China which wasn't bad.<br \/><br \/>I suggest you order a size above what you normally need whenever buying something from an Asian company because sizes tend to run small. I'm normally a M (pants size 6) and I ordered a L. They shipped me an XL by accident. The XL fits me fairly well, but it's very slightly loose near the top band. I don't know if it'll stretch out over time, so I don't know if I should return it and get the L. But I'll keep the XL for now and see how it wears.<br \/><br \/> Overall, the product looks great and I am happy with the purchase. Looks just like the picture."}

{"label":4,"review":"I loved these socks. I have a hard time finding the right socks, because my feet are really tiny. These socks fit just right, they are soft and comfortable, and they don't make my feet hot like most socks. I washed them and they still feel brand new and soft. I gave a pair to my sister to try, she has bigger feet than me, and they fit her feet perfect too. I have never locked a pair of socks so much."}

{"label":2,"review":"Doesn't even cover my butt. I'm 5'2 and 110 lbs but sooooo cute!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered this hat and it is great.  I have used other hats that have been good, but this one is very lightweight. It can be adjusted to fit the head and it has a chin strap to help hold in place in windy weather. The flap in the back is larger to protect the neck from the sun, but it also has a bit of velcro, so that it can be folded up to half its length.  I have been very pleased with the purchase."}

Every time I wear it, I get compliments (which is very odd - since it is really not what I would consider a fashion piece) - maybe because it's just so adorable on people!"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a very nice wallet... It has one feature that is very unique. Most wallets have a transparent plastic window for the area that usually holds the drivers license. The plastic quickly degrades, cracks and turns yellow with age. Levi eliminated the plastic and uses a fine mesh screen which seems a lot more sturdy and I am sure will last a lot longer than the plastic. This tells me that someone at Levi took a good look at the weaknesses of other wallet designs and took steps to improve their product."}

{"label":2,"review":"Pros, Good quality shirt, well made, reasonably priced. Color is solid and buttons firm.  Cons--the shirt is very square, dropping from the chest straight down.  This might be a plus for you but I was hoping for something with more of a shape to it. Also, the Cotton content is so high that I had to wash & iron it right out of the box.  I don't know how long it has been since I have had to iron a shirt, so I was a bit disappointed about that. I will wear this shirt, so it is not a waste, but i will not wear it to work, which was my intention when i purchased it."}

The material is lightweight, but not so lightweight that you can see through it.  The webbing at the top doesn't look quite like the product photo when you put it on, but it still looks amazing.  I gotten several compliments wearing this top. Attached is a photo showing the neckline."}

Perfect fit.  Long enough to cover my rear-end = bonus!  Happy with the colors in the package.  Material is very soft.  At this point, I'm very satisfied.  Haven't worn tops beyond trying them on yet.  Will update if necessary regarding wear and results of washing."}

{"label":4,"review":"As the title suggests, it's a wallet. The material seems like genuine leather. It's been a couple of months already and so far it seems to be holding up. It has a glossy finish. Looks classy, in my personal opinion. I like the braided design on the back side. It gives it a certain feel when holding it. It's quite pleasant. I took out the \\\\\"extra\\\\\" pockets to make it slimmer. It looks much better without the extra pockets. I highly recommend this wallet as a replacement or second wallet."}

I purchased this bra because the price was reasonable and it even looked kinda pretty...what a nice surprise that it fit perfectly (no tugging or adjusting while wearing) and was so comfortable with it's all-cotton construction.  It felt like it had been made just for me.  Great support and separation.  There is no \\\\\"stretch\\\\\" factor in this bra, again it is all cotton so wash carefully to avoid shrinking. The only negatives would be that straps do not adjust and I don't think it's available in any other color but white. I found the sizing to be true."}

The color was a nice saturated, even blue and the fit was perfect. The price was very reasonable considering how much the jeans usually cost. Overall not bad at all."}

{"label":4,"review":"Very cute and great price. I am 5'7 1\/2 and weigh 239lbs and it fits great! When I first pulled it out of the package I was a bit intimidated because it looks small but its kind of made out of a thicker panty hose type material so it stretches well. Does seem like it may need to be handled with care though and hand washed because it is a bit delicate but for the price that was expected. My husband absolutely loves it on me though and it camouflages problem areas and doesn't make me look like a roly poly lol."}

The crotch is meant to be baggy for everyone who keeps complaining its really annoying, thats the style of the product, thats how its meant to fit. You cant take off stars because they provide the product as its meant to be. Its a japanese pajama kigurumi so i suggest unknowledgable buyers see images of it before buying. As shown i love the dino. I make him  wear my glasses sometimes. I also bought matching feeties."}
{"label":3,"review":"BEAUTIFUL wig. The hair is soft and shiny, not coarse. The braid is very thick and well made. Oh can wear it hanging down your back like Rapunzel in Tangled or on your shoulder like the girl pictured. But it is HEAVY. I sewed 5 wig clips into mine to keep it from moving but it pulls your neck as it hangs because of the weight. Pain before beauty right?!? I would still purchase this same one because of how amazing it looks. Best rapunzel wig out there for the price. For anything this nice you're looking at $200 and up."}

I like the style, which is a perfect hybrid for both dress and casual use.  Only note is the buckle is silver-colored...on the picture I had expected gold-toned.  Aside from that, I would highly recommend this belt!"}

I contacted the seller and they were very kind and efficient and gave me a full refund! If you do not like heavy earrings do not purchase. However, if the size doesn't bother your ears, they look nice."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great hoodie, my son loves it! Great material, warm and well-made. He is rugged with his clothes and this has stood up to his wear and many washes. So many clothes these days are worn too easily and look rough after a couple of washed, this hoody still looks brand new and I'm pretty sure he will out grow it before its lifetime is up. Very good quality at a great price."}

{"label":2,"review":"For my $30, I wasn't expecting a lot. As expected, the material is low (costume) quality, I can see the white of my teeth through both lining & dress (I bought red), so I'll need to add a better lining, & the bust is just a hot mess. There is NO stability to it whatsoever-there's a 1\/4&#34; line of barely-stretched elastic at the top, there's not enough chiffon so it's not quite gathered like it should be, there's nothing in there to help it hold its shape, & the bust comes off looking weird.<br \/>My ribbon is long enough to tie front or back.<br \/>If you can sew, to add bust stability\/liner\/extra bling (thank you, Amazon, for stocking sew-on rhinestones), & catch this dress for $30 (I noticed the price has already jumped since my purchase), it's worth it. I got exactly what I was expecting, so I wasn't disappointed-hence the three stars. Had I been expecting David's Bridal quality, I'd be upset."}
{"label":2,"review":"Loved the dress. Hips fit just right  The length was perfect. I am 5'7'' 162lbs. Too tight across the back , couldn't zip it close.<br \/>Still have the item. Decided too loose 5 lbs just to wear it."}

{"label":1,"review":"Looking for a few late season Henley's and ordered this one.  I was surprised when it showed up as the color was NOTHING like what is shown in the pictures.  I ordered the &#34;gravel&#34; color which in product photos looks like a light tan.  The product is actually dark brown.<br \/><br \/>Fit is also terrible.  The torso for this henley is tent sized (I am pretty muscular and normally take a large size but I would probably fit in a small for this one) yet the arms are very short (probably reason that in all the photos the models have the sleeves rolled up).<br \/><br \/>Grudgingly giving it two stars since the fabric\/stitch quality is adequate and it might fit someone with a different build than me... however the strange garment proportions, completely wrong color, etc, left me wanting to give it 1 star.<br \/><br \/>Will be sending back.... this is a good reminder on why I normally don't buy clothing online."}
{"label":1,"review":"The fit was right on for me but the material was really was not to my liking.  My wife told me she thought they would soften up agter a few washings but that hasn't happened.

The picture does not do it any justice. I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out the package. I originally ordered it in a size 16 (my true size) and it was too large in the chest area (I'm a 36DD) so I ordered it in size 14 and it was just a touch too large in the chest area again but when I put on my strapless bra it fit perfectly. It was a little too long (I'm 5'3&#34;) but that was remedied when I put on my shoes (3&#34; black strappy sandals). I received many compliments on my beautiful gown even from the bride, I will definitely order from this seller again."}

Now, I have to purchase my own bix and pay for shipping to London !!? Seller was Cashmere.com."}

I have read that some people complain about them not being long enough, but I am 75&#34; tall and so long as you wear over-the-calf socks you should not have an issue.

Though I personally don't like snug fit clothing...in think it rubs at her elbows. (that goes for all snug fit clothing). Very prompt shipping and it was wrapped like a gift from the seller. It fits my daughter who is already 29&#34;at 9 mts."}

{"label":4,"review":"good"}
{"label":3,"review":"I think, how does the product fit question should be changed to &#34;Fit as hoped&#34; rather than as expected because I felt as though I was gambling. The hat might be a tad to large for my small headed six year old grandson, but it does protect his head and leaves room for growth.  He loves the hat and it appears well made."}
{"label":4,"review":"They came right away and I couldnt wait to put them on. They were so comfy and sexy. They are washable I was able to wear them about 11 or 12 times before having to throw them out from stretching. I am definitely going to purchase another pair."}

If I had to do it over, I might have secured it to the waistline of my dress. It was really full, though, which was great. I almost bought two thinking I'd have to stack them, but that wasn't at all necessary."}

{"label":4,"review":"I bought the grey\/brown\/black set. I wanted socks to go inside boots that are little snug for thick socks. These are smooth and light weight and slip right in without being so shear that I think they will immediately run like pantyhose. The grey have the prettiest pattern and will look nice showing above the short boots. I wear a size 9W and they fit nicely. They might fall down on skinny ankles, but they are perfect for my plus size ankles (22 pants size).  (If you ever review socks please indicate what size you wear. Lots of reviews complained about sizing but were totally useless to me without knowing the size of the person's feet and ankles). These socks are not my around the house socks, for that I wear padded men's exercise socks which are much warmer.  I'm ordering 3 more sets and throwing out all my other light weight socks (yay! for the exit of the ugly gold toe)."}
{"label":3,"review":"I really like this shirt.  The material is good, and it seems made very well.  My only complaint would be that it runs really big.  I usually buy XL in shirts, but I really could have went to a M or atleast a L in this shirt.  Other than that, I love it.  Put a tank on underneath and it is adorable!  I will probably just deal with the 'largeness' rather than return it."}

Every choice seemed to include an underwire.  After all these years, however, I started to have a chronic pain in the breast.  My doctor told me the culprit is probably the underwire as it has been known to affect nerves and muscle in some cases. She suggested I try a wireless bra. This bra has done the trick for me. It is comfortable and gives me just the right amount of padding. And no more pain!"}

Overall it was an awesome buy!"}

{"label":4,"review":"Cute and very unusual! It looks exactly as I expected - the &#34;wood&#34; part is plastic and the other parts are bronze-colored metal glued on. The little dove on a chain is cute, but I don't know what role it is supposed to play. But it's the owl part I really love. I have a screen protector so I am not concerned about that. This protects my iPhone in style and in a way no one expects. I couldn't be happier. I'll check back in 3 months to see how I feel then. But now, I'm loving it.  Added July 2015: I'm still loving this case! The little dove is hard to deal with, so I only use it on &#34;special occasions&#34;. But it's very pretty and, what can I say, owls make you wise!"}

I had to go out Thursday and search the Mall to find something comparable.  I did, i found a Calvin Klein @ Dillards.  Had to pay twice a much, but i had to have it.  It was a XL, fit perfectly.  I ordered the XXL here and it barely went across my back and the sleeves was at least an inch or two above my elbows.  The sizing say 16-18... NOT even close it fit like a small maybe medium.  On a positive note, the fabric was very nice and the color was a true Red."}

The hood it's self is huge, folds over your face if you are not wearing a helmet. The arms are not way big, Infact if worn with a hoody they will be tight. The shoulders are cut small and it would look a lot better on, if they tappered it better to the waist. This is more of a light jacket, 40 degree temps are as cold as you are going to wear it. I'm 5'9&#34;, 195lbs and doubt if I will be able to layer this with a hoodie.."}

{"label":2,"review":"I gave it a shot, nothing special about it. The second I tried it on, I could feel how it kept in the heat, and that is not going to work for sports during summer days. I like strappy shirts for playing, such as HEAD's Teardrop Line Bra Tank or their Line It Up Bra Tank. This was way too covering for those hot summer days of playing paddle sports.<br \/><br \/>Another thing, I ALWAYS take a small in HEAD's products (and I have bought a lot, about 20) and this one was way off the mark. For some reason I ordered the X-Small as well as the Small when it was on Lightning Deals, and I was glad I did, for I was swimming in the Small and the X-Small fit perfectly. So if you want it fitted, go a size down. For reference, I am 5' 6.5&#34; Tall, 120 Lbs., 36A, 25, 37 and the X-Small was perfect. It was light, though nothing special, so I sent it back. Just a warning, it is a size too large, unless you want that. Hope this helps, and check out the pictures. (I am wearing the X-Small in them)"}

If you like your arms and shoulders, you will love how this makes you feel. I can wear this by itself or throw on one of those light weight cardigans for a different look. I chose not to wear the self belt as it sits way too high above my natural waistline. It looks nice without the belt or I can cut the loops and wear it lower. The neckline is flattering and the length is perfect for me. It does not drag on the ground like so many other maxi dresses. You can dress this up or down. The other detail that impressed me was that the pattern on the side seams matches! I have another Chevron maxi dress that I kept even though the seams did not match up. I'm leaving that dress home on this trip."}

I'm not sure if it was that there was more room in the bust than I needed (I'm 36A) or if the waist was cut large (usually it's the opposite for me) but it draped in an odd way that was almost -- but not quite -- flattering. I've found this with other Adiranna Papell dresses too. Not sure if it's just me or the brand.<br \/><br \/>The color is beautiful, so no complaints there. The only issue I had is that it said &#34;do not iron&#34; and the material DEFINITELY needs to be ironed -- it was a wrinkled mess when it arrived. So that might present some care issues.

Although my 5yo can do buttons and frequently even zips her own clothes in the back, she cannot undo or button these buttons.  Rompers make it difficult to use the bathroom anyway, but this design is irritating.  A zipper on the side or even snaps at the crotch would be nice...anything but this idea."}

However in a single trip the luggage started falling apart. So far the handle has broken on the big suitcase, and the strap on the tote bag has broken. I know that luggage gets abused and mishandled when travelling, but to not survive a single trip one way, that's just nuts. The  seller ( Luggage Point) is also strangely unresponsive to my requests for an exchange of the item. Don't be suckered like I was get something else!!!!"}

I wear a size 8 in every other brand of jean. A size 7 in these fit like a a pair of tights. To make matters worse, there was shredding on two spots of one of the legs. Needless-to-say, these are on their way back to Amazon right now!"}

{"label":4,"review":"[[VIDEOID:2d80796bcf0ee5f73e464c37c5e19ae4]]UPDATED SPETEMBER 2015:<br \/><br \/>I have using this belt for 4 months now and still absolutely love it! I wear the belt daily (Mon-Fri) and I am constantly moving around. I also use a hip case for my mobile phone. The belt leather has actually been one of the first belts not to wear down where I slip the case on the belt. From my perspective it is very durable.  On the other hand I have noticed wear on the edging of the belt where it passes through the back pant loops. As for the buckle, it has proved to be very reliable. The finish has not worn down or chipped away nor has it lost any grip on the belt leather.<br \/><br \/>I still rate this belt a 5 star and a must own in any man'a wardrobe.<br \/><br \/>ORIGINAL REVIEW: MAY 2015<br \/><br \/>Before purchasing this belt I researched many track style belt options available online. The main reason I ordered the Slidebelt over the other options (Trackline, Mission Belt, Nextbelt, Easybelt) is because of the integrated design of the release mechanism into the buckle.  The other options all have an additional lever that protrudes from buckle that you have to depress to loosen the belt.  I feel this really makes a different for the overall appearance of the bucket and belt.  As for the operation of the buckle, I find it very easy to put on and take off.  I like the idea of only having to apply pressure to the outside portion of the buckle instead of trying to locate a lever to release the belt.<br \/><br \/>I read many other reviews on this belt and felt some of them may have had some merit when discussing quality. While I have only been wearing the belt for 1 day now (with plans to provide future updates), I haven't noticed any of the quality issues that have been discussed in some of the other reviews. All the craftsmanship appears to be in good working order and functioning correctly.  While the belt is genuine leather and has a soft feel to it unlike some other genuine leather belts I have owned, which I prefer.  Below is a link to Slidebelt's site for their premium leather belt that also includes a picture showing the differences between their full-grain, top-grain and genuine leather materials.<br \/><br \/>Something small to note is the company, not Amazon, immediately contacted me (via email) to ensure my order arrived and everything was to my satisfaction.

When I read it was for ages 3mos-12mos, I thought that window sounded too good to be true, and in fact a more accurate description would have been 6mos-12mos. My 4-month old son found it to be quite a bit too big, even with a warm outfit underneath. We also dispensed with the face mask, but the cap seemed to work OK."}

Ended up with top fat, back fat and side fat, which I've never had before (I'm not overweight). Just not a good fit for me although the quality of the fabric\/construction is beautiful. At least they paid for the return shipping, unlike Herroom, which made me pay for it."}

{"label":4,"review":"They fit perfectly. I ordered the large petite and its great because now I don't have to hem them. The waist is tight enough that my pants stay up with my pockets weighed down, but are not so tight as to be uncomfortable. LOVE the cargo pockets on both sides!!! Perfect! Will definitely be buying these same pants when I need more. I already bought three pairs."}

I'd wake up and be so stiff it woukd snap once I got out of bed and rough throughout the day. I do spinning, running, bodypump and yoga as well as other cardio. I took a chance with these as I knew all my other phiten products were phenomenal, discs for my knee I had surgery on and necklace for stamina and flexibility. I woke up not in as much pain but throughout the day the pain would slowly go away. I can do stretches wearing them and hopefully get to a recovery point as if this injury never happened."}

There are two things though; firstly, they have used white thread so you really notice the seams. Secondly, the pink is more of a strong coral color (very nice, though).

Because of the colors I washed it in cold (bright -colors) but it started to fade after the third washing!  :-(  I was worried about it shrinking but it didn't shrink!<br \/>It doesn't bother him - he still wearsit but it doesn't look as good with the orange at the bottom faded."}

{"label":3,"review":"I've used other brands & wanted to try these because they are much cheaper. They are the same material as Zaggora or Delfin just slightly thinner which is nice in the hot New York summers. The waist comes up high under the belly button which I wanted to help with muffin top. The only thing that was off for me was, they fit good & are comfortable but a little bit baggy in the croch area. Not terrible just not as tight as others that I own. It's good thought because as your sweating(and you sweat) I can move around comfortably as were the others will stick in place like they are glued on. I Will DEFINATLY buy these again."}

{"label":4,"review":"GREAT for shorter people.  I'm 5'1\\\\\", 120lb and got the XSP.  Buying pants with an inseam short enough for me is a huge challenge.  These are the perfect length for me - I can wear them with completely flat sneakers (I have minimalist shoes, which pretty much means no added height whatsoever) as well as my hiking shoes and clogs (an extra 1\\\\\" or so) without looking funny either way.    The slight flare and side slits by the ankle give these pants some shape, and look flattering (unlike the disproportional ones on another brand that look very odd on shorter people).    Material is crisp and has some weight, so the pants drape nicely, hold their shape, and provide a decent barrier in colder weather;  you don't feel like you're leaving the house in just pajamas.    Color is a dark, saturated navy blue when brand new.  After 7 months (which includes a 2-month period where I was washing them everyday in hot water), the color has lightened a tiny bit and the material is a bit softer.  Still happy with them, and will definitely get more of these as needed."}

It dries fast (great material). However, I was a little disappointed that the material is not supposed to be machine-washed but HAND WASH! For such a large garment, machine washing is much more convenient, especially on trips to the beach on vacation. I won't always have time on a more lengthy trip to hand wash a single dress. This is a huge downside. I did wash mine in the machine carefully on a delicate cycle, and it seems fine. I see the potential for it to shrink terribly. Great look, though!"}

{"label":4,"review":"These jeans are a godsend for women who are truly curvy, with a high ratio between waist and hip measurements! (If you're one of us, you know it, you know the fitting room trauma, and you'll be thrilled with these! If you're not, the fit will seem odd to you.) Lately there have been more offerings on the market for pants claiming to be \\\\\"curvy\\\\\" fit, in which \\\\\"curvy\\\\\" apparently just means heavy, and the waist gap is just as much a problem as ever. Not these! Do swallow your pride and buy a size up--just the way Levi's sized them. If you're on the taller side, definitely do find these jeans in a long. I am 5' 9\\\\\", and the long just touches the top of my foot, no fold in the pants."}

{"label":4,"review":"After reading the reviews and doing a LOT of research, I finally broke down and purchased 2 of these pillows - one for me and one for hubby.<br \/><br \/>We both suffer from back and neck problems and have arthritis and osteoarthritis.  We also go to the chiropractor frequently for adjustments and massages.  I always run things by our chiropractor before purchase to get his opinion and he was all for me getting these.<br \/><br \/>Well, I'll tell you - we LOVE these little things!  As neither of us can easily blow anything up - even though we are both \\\\\"full of hot air\\\\\" - my husband used the little pump that came with my exercise ball to blow these up and it worked fine.  I bought ours at another site that offers a velvet-like material on the front.  Of course, the velvet-like material one does not have the strap like the vinyl one has but that's okay with us.  We have ours on our dining room chairs and they are wonderful!  We don't sit on them, but have them placed behind our backs.<br \/><br \/>We had family over for Easter and my brother-in-law sat in hubby's chair and commented on how great the pillow felt on his back.  He suffers from severe back pain due to several previous injuries and like us, has tried other pillows.  After they left, my husband told me we are going to have to get his brother one so I guess that is what he'll be getting for Christmas this year.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend this little Pocket Pillow to everyone suffering from any kind of back or neck pain."}

{"label":4,"review":"I love this sweater! The material is lighter than I expected but I consider that a bonus. It is a little itchy but once washed with fabric softener a couple times it will be fine. Not restricting like many pull over sweaters are. Great to wear with a long tee underneath. I am a solid 16 and I bought the US18. Works for me since I really like the baggy look. For most, I would suggest ordering a size down. So comfy and cozy! Great for lazy days or running errands.  I wore it for the first time yesterday with black leggings and cute charcoal colored flats and received 2 compliments. I had no issues with the hood or sleeves. Arrived odor free and much sooner than expected. Can't beat the price!"}

My 7 yr old who weighs 75 pounds tried it on the XL T-Shirt and it fit her perfect, the way it is suppose to fit.<br \/><br \/>But overall the quality of the shirt is good and the cotton fabric is very soft.

However even though it's dark blue and a snugger fit, it's still a great top. In fact, I've worn it just about every day when I get home from work. It's super comfy and washes wonderfully.  Can't beat it."}

She wanted something that looked really fancy. We came upon this dress and she fell in love. It arrived in a very timely fashion with Prime. The box was small and I was worried that it wouldn't be as full as the picture. When I got it out of the box, it already started to fill out, and was stunning after a quick steam in the bathroom and a little fluffing. My daughter was the Belle of the ball. She said it fit perfectly and she was very comfortable and didn't want to take it off at the end of the night.<br \/><br \/>I would definitely buy this dress and any other from Wonder Girl again. They are stunning and high quality. Wonder Girl will probably be my go-to for any formal dress I need for my daughter in the future."}

It is very soft wool, but is completely structured.  The brim is rolled with a nice binding.  If you want a really nice top hat for formal or steampunk affairs (which is what I bought it for) you cannot go wrong with this beauty."}

{"label":3,"review":"I had seen a men's belt with a ratcheting system called the Mission Belt on Shark Tank and it definitely caught my eye. However, there aren't any stores locally that carried it for me to try it in person. Later, I noticed that Amazon had a daily deal on an EazyBelt and when I read the description and read the reviews, it seemed very similar to what I had seen on Shark Tank. Since it was a Daily Deal at only $17, it was definitely worth a try. I ordered a size 30 and it came at the perfect size (although you can trim it further if needed). It might take a little getting used to, and early on there was 1 time when I thought I'd be trapped in my pants. : ) However, after wearing it for over a month, it works really well. The buckle is definitely heavier than on a normal belt since it has the ratcheting hardware built-in. Other than the weight, the buckles are stylish, interchangeable, quality is good and it works as advertised.<br \/>A couple tips: Although it self-ratchets as you insert and tighten the belt, I've noticed that the ratcheting toggle switch may not always fully engage so it helps if you press the switch toward yourself. When trying to remove or loosen the belt, pull the switch away from yourself. To remove the belt, it may be necessary to give the belt a slight nudge forward while pulling on the switch at the same time."}

On the first day I tried the bra discs, I was amazed. I have been wearing them frequently and have had zero problems. They work 100% and you cannot tell in the least, even under a white shirt -- such a simple design, yet so effective and so easy to wear and remove.

After all, boxers are intended for men who prefer hanging LOOSE.<br \/><br \/>Altogether, these are great boxers, especially in warm weather."}

The gloves fit perfectly and are slightly pinker than claret or oxblood; a lovely, unusual color which makes them &#34;pop&#34; - maybe too much for boots or a jacket, but exactly what you want in a glove. They are classically styled and of good quality. The P&H doubled the price, but it was still much less than I would pay at a department store here."}

As others have said, it's a little more yellow than the picture shows, but it's still a good, relaxed color for males or females.<br \/><br \/>I ordered an XL, which is my normal size, and it fits great through the torso and shoulders.

The strap on the hat has a velcro closure, but it attaches on the outside of one of the ear flaps, so it won't scratch your little one's neck or ear. A good item at a great price."}

Be informed that these shorts are plenty generous, and I'd say true-to-size.  Color is between an olive green and a khaki.  Different, therefore, from the picture, but still neutral.  I like them."}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice tee! Soft fabric. Comfortable to wear. Correctly sized. Excellent quality. And super cute!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I really loved this shirt but I didn't realize there was a quotation in RED across the top.  Did he really say that line? Sounds kinda dorky for the most outspoken athelete of all time...nevertheless, I still love the shirt."}
{"label":4,"review":"Extremely soft fabric, very warm and comfortable. Can't go wrong with carhardt."}
{"label":4,"review":"perfect fit and high quality"}
{"label":4,"review":"Very nice material, bought this for my 14 mth old."}
{"label":1,"review":"This item is nothing like the matching underwear. The material is difference and its not a balconnet. Its a full bra and quality is cheaper. The panties were the original reason for buying the bras. However, there is no comparison between the two though its suppose to be the same set. The same applies to the Caramel bra. The company did send me a label for the return despite the return policy where the purchaser is to pay for it. They were both prompt and courteous."}
{"label":4,"review":"great"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is our 2nd sun suit from iPlay. We love the quality and ease of use (easy zip, easy to dry). Sun coverage is fantastic. And it's hysterically cute.<br \/>I'm just bummed they don't have bigger than 3t sizing."}
{"label":4,"review":"This is an awesome t-shirt that I recommend to any one who is a true SOA fan! A must have!"}
{"label":0,"review":"poor design. my breasts hang out of this! dont buy"}
{"label":3,"review":"I like this shirt alot. It is very forgiving of the bulges. I have washed it 4 times so far and still see some green dye in the water so I guess I will always wash it by itself."}
{"label":0,"review":"I usually buy Hanes comfort soft boxers which are similar to these, however the local Kmart was out of the Hanes version for the last few weeks, so I figured i would try these.<br \/>They had a funky chemical odor right out of the package, but i figured that washing them would fix it.  I threw them in the wash with some of my other laundry.  Huge mistake. After two washes, not only do these underwear still wreak, so do the other clothes I washed with them.  It seems I will now have to throw out some of my clothes in addition to these boxers as well.<br \/><br \/>I'm so disappointed!<br \/><br \/>And yes, like some of the other recent posters, the colors are aqua and red-pink and some other bright ones."}
{"label":2,"review":"The tie arrived wrapped in plastic, no snags or imperfections in the design or fabric.  I would recommend purchasing this to anyone who would be charmed by it. It's very nicely made."}
{"label":2,"review":"Love this suit.  It is a bit see through, but you really have to look hard to see anything.  The tan-through part is the reason for the low star rating.  I did get some sun through the suit, but nearly enough to keep from getting horrible tan lines."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love the zig zag print and the interesting neckline.  I like the way the belt looks.  Very comfortable!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Great bra! I have worn this style for a few years. Nordstroms doesn't carry this style online at this time. I tried Amazon, and they had what I wanted, at a terrific price. Exactly the same as the bra I bought through Nordstrom."}
{"label":3,"review":"I love this costume. It's super cute and doesn't look like every other angel costume. Love the gold halo and wings. Only problem I have was that I ordered 6-18 months and the tag and packaging said newborn. It's even bunted for a smaller baby unlike the picture shows. But it's big like its sized for 6+ months. My baby is a little too big for bunting though so I cut open the bottom. Problem solved. And it does look slightly different from the picture shown. But overall I'm happy with it because its just too cute!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Love them!"}
{"label":0,"review":"Do not buy! Du rag style. Very small and the color was way off from what I ordered. And when I try to return it the customer is asking for pictures and making it impossible to return. Stay away!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered the blue one and it fits perfectly , I love this dress and thinking to order different color."}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought this for my sister and it fits her well. Looks good overall.<br \/><br \/>I am very pleased with this product."}
{"label":3,"review":"It fit my 7 year old  daughter pretty well. However, it is slightly see through especially at the top. She likes it."}
{"label":4,"review":"Excellent workmanship, nice and warm, cozy. Good color combination and cut. It fits better than any robe I've ever had"}
{"label":4,"review":"I like these bras, apparently they have been discontinued in my SMALL size or all-together, because I can't find them anymore.  They are comfortable and fit well.  It's a shame that companies seem to be phasing out smaller sized bras.  I find something I really like, then they disappear."}
{"label":4,"review":"love these jeans!!!!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Awesome."}
{"label":0,"review":"I really wanted to love this hoodie and when I saw that it was on sale I scooped it up ASAP. I got a black one for my friend, and a grey one for myself. As a cat lady, I counted down the minutes until such an awesome article of clothing would be in my hands. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Unfortunately for me, it was WAY too small. I ordered larges and they were anything but. They probably would have fit a 10 year old, definitely not a 35 year old woman."}
{"label":1,"review":"The gray runs small"}
{"label":3,"review":"They fit really well and are still doing me well.<br \/><br \/>One thing to be aware of is that the dye is a really dark blue and will fade dramatically over time if machine washed. They'll end up being somewhat dark blue jeans. Still a great buy though."}
{"label":3,"review":"Fits  fine. Just like other maxi skirts."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great for potty training a toddler! They wash nice and still are in great condition!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Hands down the most comfortable bra I've ever worn!"}
{"label":4,"review":"This dress has to be one of the most flattering that I have ever owned!  I am 5'7 130lbs and I ordered a small.  It hits right at my knee caps (like pictured).  The stomach area is slightly bunched which adds a sexy hourglass silhouette while hiding any belly flaws!  This is buy far the best little black dress I have ever bought!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Great dress for the price! The top is slightly transparent, but just wear a nude colored bra and you cant see anything!"}
{"label":4,"review":"love the entire aishani line! They fit perfect, they look and make me feel sexy. Eventually will buy every pair aishani makes"}
{"label":4,"review":"I wear a 10.5 size shoe, and the socks fit great! I generally wear them with loafer-type shoes, in an effort to give the appearance of not wearing socks while covering my feet. They work exactly as expected thus far!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Alright"}
{"label":4,"review":"Very comfortable casual pants.  Great for kicking around the office."}
{"label":4,"review":"very cute, arrived quickly and it fits as stated. I really like it for a costume."}
{"label":0,"review":"The scarf I received was nothing like the pic. The pic is silky and short. I use it as a head wrap because it's to flimsy to be a scarf"}
{"label":3,"review":"Fingers are too long."}
{"label":4,"review":"So, let's see here.  You've got a shirt made in Honduras by what I believe is nominally a US-based company, but the only way you can get one here is to order it from a UK operation.<br \/><br \/>They're good shirts, and a good value.<br \/><br \/>Ordered two batches of them so far.  The first one came very quickly - four days, I think.  The second batch took more like two weeks."}
{"label":3,"review":"Bought this for a date with my husband.  I walked out in this and he was like wow!  I am 160 pounds and 36 33 38.  I got a large.  It definitely hugs your curves.  It is worth buying."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this on a whim for my grand daughter's Christening, knowing my daughter didn't have a dressy coat for her. It came in a couple days and fit her perfectly.  I kept overhearing people commenting on how cute it was!"}
{"label":4,"review":"These things are genius!  And a GREAT baby shower present...something you don't think of until you need them!  I love them!"}
{"label":4,"review":"My husband loved this - good quality and was a great first Fathers Day gift !!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Came in a timely fashion, it is true to size and it is awesome, kind of sheer but not too sheer ( I love sheer). Looks great feels great."}
{"label":4,"review":"Looove this top! I was worried it wouldnt look as good as the pictures but it does! Comfortable, fits well, I wish I bought all the colors, I only got gray, but I love it!"}
{"label":0,"review":"This is much more see through than it appears in this photo. It also has a strange construction in the back that makes it fall a bit askew... Not my favorite \ud83d\ude12"}
{"label":4,"review":"Very nice fitting and look good on. They also fit like a shaper that holds your stomach in. I would purchase again. Beautiful colors as well. My guy lives the way they fit my butt."}
{"label":4,"review":"These boxer briefs work great for our toddler. True to size and wash well.  Will be ordering more as needed."}
{"label":4,"review":"Perfect fit, well made as expected from Gold Toe"}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought the top and matching pants. The set is so comfortable, I feel like I'm working in my pajamas. I'm not sure of the material but it's definitely not the usual scrub material. With the cute little tie on the side, I get a lot of compliments every time I wear them  ."}
