{"label":5,"review":"Fits my 18 month old perfect! Good quality! Bought a nautica suit last year and doesn't fade! Would buy over and over again! Also, great price!"}
{"label":3,"review":"The blouse is very comfortable and beautiful. My only problem with it is that it buttons up the front and buttons always gap across the chest. I wear a black camisole under it and it isn't noticeable."}

{"label":5,"review":"My son bought this hoodie and he loves it.  Loves to zip up the whole hood when he was in Michigan and it was real windy."}

{"label":5,"review":"This top really has great structure.  Comfortable and great fit!"}
{"label":5,"review":"It's a good pair. I wear it everywhere."}
{"label":4,"review":"This is very stylish, but it is made on the smaller side. It feels somewhat tight when I button it up. If unbuttoned, the fit is perfect. I guess it does say Slim Fit in the description. I've been given compliments on the style of this sweater several times. Please note that the material is somewhat translucent; you can make out what color you're wearing underneath, especially if you're wearing a darker tone.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I like this sweater. It is very stylish and comfortable. Be careful about the size that you order."}
{"label":2,"review":"Not very comfortable at all. They fit very awkwardly and sit very high on the stomach."}
{"label":1,"review":"Thie wig was not as pictured. It was unevenly cut, not the perfect chin length bob pictured, and not the same shade of pink (but thats not too bad). Its just over al disappointing and i will ve returning this and asking for my money back."}

{"label":5,"review":"this is a gorgeous little outfit very happy with it bought as a present"}
{"label":3,"review":"The mask was extremely uncomfortable."}
{"label":5,"review":"Very nice quality."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great product.  You can still wear a baseball cap with it."}
{"label":2,"review":"These are very thin and made of some type of harder polyester, I thought they would be pure cotton and spandex like the brand suggests, but it's not. They get bigger as you wear them and are hard to stay up unlike their previous Kalon clothing from a year ago. Not happy with this purchase, they're not see-through, but they feel it."}
{"label":5,"review":"Loved the petticoat.  It was exactly what was needed to complete the dress I am making for my granddaughter.  Great service and arrived on time."}
{"label":3,"review":"I have small calves, and boots can look like I'm wearing buckets.  So, I wear mine with tall boots to fill in the gaps."}
{"label":4,"review":"The fabric is soft and comfy and they are very well made. The fit runs a bit large so next time I would go smaller."}
{"label":5,"review":"The material is good. The jacket is warm, fits well, looks good, and all in all good product for less money."}
{"label":5,"review":"This slip dress is great. It is not like those old slips that were made off a silky material. It is cotton and comfortable. I am a size 12 and I got the perfect size for me. It is soft and fits well. It is well made and did not shrink when washed. There has not been any issues with the stitching at all. I am glad I was able to purchase this at a discounted rate in return for my honest unbiased review. It is exactly what I needed"}

{"label":3,"review":"I like the shirt but not the sleeves so I cut them off."}
{"label":1,"review":"This item did not look at all as advertised. The goggles were completely clear, no black tint, and the mask was a washed out gray color rather than black. It also doesn't fit a very wide variety of head shapes (it was too big for my younger sister, whom I bought it for, and didn't fit my dad correctly, either). I would consider it a miracle that the textures on the mask are the only, and I mean only, thing about this product that looks right."}
{"label":2,"review":"The sweater is not made out of the best yarn.  Stitching at shoulder was not even. Had purchased for school,but it will be for play. Beautiful color though unfortunately ,quality not as good as other items I've purchased from this site."}

{"label":5,"review":"Really soft and warm thermal underwear"}
{"label":5,"review":"I wish I would've never listened to the other reviews on here and ordered a size small instead of a medium. The skirt has plenty of stretch to it and even ruching on the sides. I am all hips, thighs, and butt. I had plenty of room to spare in this skirt. It definitely highlighted my &#34;assets&#34; but I would've preferred more. I am 5`5&#34;, 136lbs, 38-27-38. This skirt is super cute. I am happy with the medium and will still rock it. I may even reorder it in a small if it seems to loosen up as I'm wearing it."}
{"label":5,"review":"Pretty!"}
{"label":3,"review":"These are OK for the price. They do the job of keeping sun off the child, but they fade very quick and stretch out. Barely good for a season."}
{"label":5,"review":"Too small for my 6 month baby..."}
{"label":5,"review":"love it"}
{"label":5,"review":"This is so cute and I love the way it looks on my baby, but it seems to run just the tiniest bit small compared to all my baby's other clothing."}
{"label":5,"review":"my new favorite sweater. I am a hoodie guy when it comes to the colder weather. if you like mazda at all you wont be disappointed on this purchase. I get complaints on this sweater because I wear so much. I wonder if it will fade to the fact that I wear and wash it so much?"}
{"label":5,"review":"This hat is exactly what I wanted. No fuss, very warm and comfortable, easy to store. On cold nights I even wear it as a nightcap because I don't have much hair on my head."}
{"label":4,"review":"Cute. Very close to the image displayed."}
{"label":4,"review":"The fit is as expected and deliver was quick"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is great shapewear. It stays up when I sit down or walk around. My only complaint is the lines formed where the bottom and top section connect. This is only an issue if you are wearing a thin form fitting dress. I normally wear a small but ordered a medium and it fit well. I recommend this shapewear!"}
{"label":4,"review":"These shorts look very nice and are comfortable. A very good buy. My husband has a little trouble with the mesh shorts inside but that's just because he's not used to it. He's probable going to cut them out which should be fine. One note to the manufacturer: one of the side pockes was sewn shut but after some time working at the stitching, I opened it up and all is fine."}

{"label":2,"review":"Small"}
{"label":4,"review":"I'm 4&#34;11 weighting at 119 lbs and waistline measures at 29 ins, which by the chart say I'm a large but I went with a medium instead. Fits good and isn't so uncomfortable but I would recommend to get a size smaller. Hope that helps anyone"}

{"label":4,"review":"Nice!"}
{"label":5,"review":"SO COOL"}
{"label":1,"review":"had a bad smell and was thrown out.  not as advertised<br \/>did not dit not did not enjoy at all"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love the fit of these! They could be just a tad longer, but I supposed the length is more on-trend this way (I'm 5'8&#34;). They are not too tight and not loose. Just right. Can wear a few days before washing."}
{"label":5,"review":"love it"}
{"label":5,"review":"I\u2019ve been stuck wearing a \u201cboot\u201d walking cast for the past 2 months. Although you\u2019re supposed to use real compression socks, these socks are a lot more comfortable and do a better job of wicking perspiration than compression socks. These socks are high quality and are durable. Compression socks cut off circulation to my leg. Cotton compression socks are expensive, and the nylon\/rayon ones are pretty much wear them once and then throw them away. I can\u2019t advocate the Gold Toe socks as compression sock replacements, but if your swelling has gone down and you\u2019re ready for something more comfortable than compression socks, ask your doctor if you can safely try switching to these socks."}
{"label":2,"review":"These were more like a ribbed velour than the corduroy material that I was expecting.  Not for me. Sizing was accurate."}
{"label":5,"review":"Beautiful,  but is a little bit small."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love them. Light control is the best!!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I purchased a medium and it was way too large.  I am 5'6&#34; weigh 127lbs athletic build (26&#34; waist, 37&#34; hips) and this dress was huge.  I also wish it were about 2 inches shorter, because it hits right above the knee.  The color was gorgeous and the material was breathable and great for summer, but I had to return this dress."}
{"label":5,"review":"My son LOVES this!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Excelent"}
{"label":5,"review":"My boy loves Minecraft so this made the perfect gift.<br \/><br \/>Sizing is perfect and quality is good so if you have a Minecraft fan, great gift"}
{"label":5,"review":"These 18 mos PJs fit my 10 month old avg sized daughter. These PJs however, are SO adorable! They are my favorite. Stretchy but not too stretchy cotton, easily washable, easy to put on, and the little flap on the bottom, albeit non functional, is very cute. Made in India."}
{"label":5,"review":"My husband wore this tie for a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Our daughter has CF and we were there to support her. The color was a perfect purple, not pink or too dark, just right. If youre reading this review, please go to cff.org and learn more about CF."}
{"label":2,"review":"Several years ago I bought 2 pr. of Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and loved them.  They have about 3 in. of elastic on each side.  They didn't have a name as far as I know.  However, they were not Amanda and that's all I can find now.  Can anyone help?"}
{"label":5,"review":"I really like this shrug, which actually surprised me because shrugs have never really been my thing. This one is super comfortable, cute, and functional\u2014and those three qualities are often difficult to find in a single garment. What I liked most about the shrug is that it is lightweight. I don't feel heavy and restricted when I'm wearing it. The lightweight quality also makes it ideal for breezy afternoons, covering up when wearing a tank top, or to prevent getting extremely cold in an air conditioned environment.<br \/><br \/>Sizing does run small (these are junior plus sizes, not women's sizes), so make sure to check the sizing chart before you make a purchase. I have a 40&#34; bust and a 3X fit me just right.<br \/><br \/>Overall, it's an adorable shrug and I'm happy to add it to my wardrobe.<br \/><br \/>* Product provided for review purposes without cost. All opinions are my own."}
{"label":4,"review":"These are the best product available for protecting our daughter's eyes from brightness. Makes time outdoors more enjoyable for everyone. Our daughter was 4.55 months old when we bought this, and her head circumference is in the 90th percentile, but the band was still a bit too large for her. Now at almost 6 months, it fits almost perfectly when set to the smallest size."}
{"label":5,"review":"Very comfortable"}
{"label":5,"review":"This is a nice coat for the price. I probably won't use the scarf, but the coat was a great deal for the price. I wear an XL coat size and this was nice and roomy without looking too big or baggy.  I'd buy it again."}
{"label":1,"review":"While an attractive garment the advertized sizing failed to meet the expectations I had. I think the garment is sized according to European standards. I had removed tags and am unable to return garment, hence a $48.00 loss for me."}
{"label":5,"review":"excellent"}
{"label":4,"review":"These jeans look good and fit me fine but they are only a medium if you wear flats. I'm 5.5&#34; and should have ordered long so I could wear my boots, which is the reason I bought them. I'm going to let the hems down as far as they will go, but I'm afraid they will still not be long enough to wear with my boots. I will wear these jeans but am disappointed."}
{"label":5,"review":"Amazingly Beauty"}
{"label":5,"review":"This shirts shipped really fast! and it looks and fits perfectly!! i already ordered 2 more in diff colors! love the distressed camo look!"}

{"label":5,"review":"cozy"}
{"label":3,"review":"This is a very elegant embellishment for my wedding dress. My only quail is that the chain separates from the belt because the links aren't very secure. This is an inconvenience but I'm still planning to wear it on my special day"}
{"label":5,"review":"A little expensive but worth every penny."}
{"label":5,"review":"My son likes it. It fits as the size should. Good quality\/construction. Not sure why Amazon requires a whole paragraph for a review."}
{"label":3,"review":"Returned the item"}
{"label":1,"review":"This is a beautiful dress and would have been absolutely perfect, BUT...it is Polyester (which I do not wear) rather than 100% cotton as the description states."}
{"label":5,"review":"Capezio has never failed to be just right!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love long tank tops\/spaghetti strap shirts and they're very difficult to find in stores. I bought these on a whim in hopes that they would magically fit me and they did! They are very comfortable and the perfect length. The price was pretty decent as well."}
{"label":5,"review":"Bien"}
{"label":5,"review":"I have to say that I do like the quality of the cap. However, I purchased the s\/m size and it's still a bit big on me. I decided to just keep it as the likelihood of me finding a hat\/cap online and it fitting is pretty slim. So, instead, I'm just going to have it taken in a little so that it can fit. I'm pretty little and with that, so is my head (good thing lol). But hats have always been an issue with me. Anyway, again, still happy with it even though it doesn't fit right now. Also, it came before the anticipated delivery date. Thanks!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Good"}
{"label":5,"review":"Though it was pricey it was a huge hit and surprisingly comfortable! I absolutely loved it! I even wore it after the holidays and got just as many laughs. It's great for parties and anyone with a sense of humor!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I have had a pair of neoprene pants before and love them. They speed up my weight loss tremendously. Saying that, I was so disappointed when I went to work out and the company I ordered from sent me an XL.  I ordered a 7, which is by no means an XL!"}

{"label":1,"review":"These underwear feel like wool, not soft what so ever. Worst buy ever unless you like roughness on your skin"}
{"label":1,"review":"Too small"}

{"label":5,"review":"Fit as expected, now my daughter can wear her &#34;itchy&#34; dresses with no problem!"}
{"label":5,"review":"This bathing suit wrap is to die for!  There is so much going on with the pattern on it, that you can't even tell that there's a logo across it.  Lots of colors so it goes well with many bathing suits.  Great for packing light on vacations."}
{"label":4,"review":"kind of wide end"}
{"label":5,"review":"after reading other reviews saying it fits small, i decided to get a size larger. im 5'2&#34;, 110lbs, and got a medium instead of a small. it was a bit big for me and doesnt shape my body as i'd like it to. so i gave the medium one to my sister, 5'3&#34; 135lbs. and it fits her perfectly. i ordered a small one for myself. this product doesnt reshape your body, it just enhances it and puts everything in the right place. it will minimize your muffin top, hides your belly button from a sheer dress, perks up your bust, and takes away any panty lines. material is good and the strap gives much support. thats why im buying one for myself. my sister loved it too. make sure you get your true size cause it's sized correctly. :)"}
{"label":5,"review":"Bought this my husband who is a big fan of sleeveless vests; he thinks this one is great. Excellent quality and outstanding value."}
{"label":3,"review":"Exactly what I wanted. It's just already coming apart after only 3-4 weeks of having it"}
{"label":3,"review":"These pants look great on the model, who must be super skinny with no butt or hips. They fit well, but with my curvy figure and those horizontal stripes, I looked very weird. I will be wearing them around the house and maybe casual trips to the drivethrough, but these are going to be lounge pants. I'm pregnant, so I was looking for something that would be comfortable and cute and low enough rise to wear through my pregnancy. These are comfortable and I will be able to wear them throughout my pregnancy, but they aren't cute on me. If you are a teenager, or stick figure, these will be super cute on you too."}
{"label":2,"review":"They were supposed to be 100% Cotton, however they appear to contain some polyester fabric. They are rough and not suited for hot days. I don't recommend due to obvious false advertising. Sorry, thought they were lovely on the page."}
{"label":5,"review":"Beautiful casual dress, thick material, great price & my daughter loves it"}
{"label":3,"review":"The bra is okay. It fits me okay. I'm just not crazy about it. For me, not having stretch straps is a big deal (and I should have noticed this before buying it). But even if it did, I don't think I'd be crazy about it. The cups are sort of polyester-ish in a bad way ... they feel weird to me. So I give it a so-so."}
{"label":5,"review":"Hubby looks HOT in these. Wore them to the Woodlake, Ca rodeo."}
{"label":5,"review":"I had ordered 5 pair of silicone ear hooks from another seller and all of them were defective so I got these instead.  These are really good.  They fit my glasses and have not disintegrated like the first ones I got.

{"label":1,"review":"You get what you pay for with this.  Maybe a good prop in a play, but definitely not an evening bag."}
{"label":1,"review":"This top is way too small.  The extra large is like a sausage casing on my size 12\/14 body.  Also the bottom part is a tight gather that wouldn't even fit around my booty.  It does not hang like the pictures at all.  I would only recommend this if you are a skinny lady that wants to flaunt her curves."}
{"label":2,"review":"The dress is too short. My girlfriend is about 5' 9&#34; and the only way we could make it work is to replace the lining."}
{"label":4,"review":"I am a size 12 and it fit me every where except my bust ( I am a 36F so I usually expect that with things). I used it for a Lucille Ball costume and it was just perfect! It is pretty cheaply made, but that is sort of what I expected from it, and still feel like it was worth the price.<br \/>I would recommend it."}

{"label":4,"review":"I ordered a large which is usually a roomy fit for me as I like loose cardigans. I could barely fit it over my arms. (My arms are average too). I gave this 4 stars because it's a beautiful Cardigan. I gave it to my size small teen daughter and it fit her perfectly.  I would say order 3 sizes larger than you are if you buy this. Since it was shipped from China I think the sizes are fit to the petite ranges."}

{"label":5,"review":"First let me say that I am a huge fan of Noble Mount's microfiber tights.  I bought a pair in every color they make in the Fall of 2012 and they are ALL still in use.  They fit well, wash well (cold water, gentle cycle of the washing machine, in a lingerie bag, hang to dry), and retain their color beautifully.  I bought a pair of these Fleece Lined Tights on a lark as a gift for my daughter for Christmas, but they never made it under the tree . . . 'cause I swiped them!  These are warm, well-constructed and the fit is terrific (I bought the M\/L and I am 5'7&#34;, 130 lbs.).  I plan to order more, in additional colors, and expect them to see me through not just this winter but the next, and the next, and the next . . . .  Thanks for a great product, Noble Mount."}
{"label":5,"review":"would recommend this selection"}
{"label":2,"review":"The colors are faded. Fits fine.  Could have done medium. I'll probably cut it up and make something out of it like a shirt. The material is like rayon. Nothing like the picture. I don't like it. Never order anything like it again. So cheap not a real loss."}

{"label":5,"review":"I love these pants.  They are thin but baggy and very comfortable.  The drawstring is a nice touch, too.  Good price."}
{"label":3,"review":"I love the Neon Buddha brand but often have trouble with their sizing.  I never wear small in anything!  But these pants in medium are just too loose-fitting and they don't shrink.  They are a bit too long as well.  Nevertheless, they are comfortable and seem to be well-made.  Price is too high."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great buy! It has performed better than expected!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Cute"}
{"label":1,"review":"A total waste of money! The material of this pant is so rough that it feels like to some cheap cloth. The size isn't accurate at all. It feels so much bigger"}
{"label":3,"review":"The actual shirt is more of like a thin sweater like material, which I didn't mind. The color of it isn't black but a really dark gray and the embellishing on the shirt is really quite nice. It really looks nothing like the picture. I'm 5' 2\\\\\" and I ordered a small. The shirt is more wider and a bit shorter than it looks, it ends exactly right below my butt. Overall I wasn't disappointed, I actually prefer how the shirt\/sweater I received looks like. I just knocked it down a star for not looking like the picture and another star because some of the embellishing had come undone but not too noticable."}

{"label":4,"review":"In spite of this being XL it fit my adult size frame well. I'm 5'2&#34; and 120 lbs, I think this must be little girls' sizing. The foil printing doesn't look cheap, which I was a little worried about."}
{"label":2,"review":"I was a little sad. The picture I saw showed two masks so I thought it came with two, but no. It was still really nice, I was just a little sad about there misleading picture."}
{"label":5,"review":"Nice shirt"}
{"label":4,"review":"I really like these shorts as a go between for my thighs in the summer. I am a size 12, and the shirts fit me very well. They are a little thin, but work so well under skirts and dresses."}

{"label":5,"review":"It fit so great on my nephew. Now all will know who's his BFF is!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Being honest, I hate all these pinkish dresses made of polyester mostly. Zutano brand is saving me in this sense. It's absolutely adorable in design - simple and stylish and mostly perfect in quality that I expect to obtain buying things for my baby. Always made of 100%cotton, being absolutely natural, all things that I buy from this brand, are comfortable for kids to use and make a rest for the eyes really tired of pink girlish color revolution around with excess of ribbons, flowers and other decoration. Amazon is completely trustful for purchasing and always provide a perfect service that is essential for on-line purchasers.<br \/>  This hat matches the top i bought together with this purchase. it goes well with several other items i got from this brand."}
{"label":1,"review":"Most torsolettes run 60-100 dollars, so when I found this for much less I jumped on the 'deal'.  NOT WORTH THE SAVINGS.  The ribbing is weak and does not hold up the 'girls'.

Skip this purchase and spend the extra cash for quality, especially if you're a larger busted figure."}

I bought it for my photography. I love to photograph nature, wildlife & Sunrise is my favorite time of day (be it hard to get up :)  I use it at my Mom's all day long but at Sunrise I sit in the yard or on the pier photographing the Osprey, Sunrise , & all of the early morning beauty on the water but the ground is usually wet even with no rain there is always the dew in the morning. This keeps my camera & all my photography stuff dry as well as me & my behind so I can sit or lie down and watch the beauty of the day beginning. I love to go to new & different parks all over to Photograph & this blanket folds up nicely even with a picket to hold a drink. I can put it over my shoulder & have a place to sit anywhere. Hiking the falls with the Grand-kids you never know if you will find a nice place but with this I can make one anywhere for picnics,resting,watching ,napping , anything. The best investment plus it is very sturdy. I have not washed it yet, just wiped it but it feels,looks ,seems to be extremely well made. Did I mention I love it, well I do. Awesome product."}

{"label":4,"review":"I mostly wear Levis 514 jeans but decided to try something different.<br \/><br \/>These jeans look nice and are quite comfortable.  One thing I didn't expect was that each belt loop is actually 2 loops, which I both like and dislike.  On one hand it's nice when you hang other things off your belt loop, like a keychain (I have my keys on a carabiner).  On the other hand it's a pain trying to get the belt into the inside loop all the way around.<br \/><br \/>When the jeans first arrived the material seemed stiff, but it loosened up without changing shape after being worn a couple times.  I ordered the 34x34, which is what all of my 514s are, and the waist on these jeans are a bit larger, more like 35 than 34.  If I were to buy another pair I'd get the 33 waist instead.<br \/><br \/>Overall these are nice jeans that look great.  But I can get at least 3 pairs of Levi 514 for the same price, and with similar washes that look just as good.  Are these jeans worth the price?  Let's just say I'm glad I didn't pay full price."}

{"label":5,"review":"I really love this tank top. It actually fits just as it says, I could have even went a size smaller. I read other reviews that said it fits small, but not for me. I like how it is a very breathable material, but not see-through. The arm holes are perfect as is the back. It doesn't show my bra straps at all, which isn't common with many tank tops I own. I do not like that look, and I know most people don't, so this is a big plus for me. The length is quite similar as the picture shown for the item, falling below the pant's waistline, just covering jean's back pockets a bit. I think this is a great summery shirt. I received mine discounted for a review of the shirt."}

I wish I had a better shrug to wear with it as my back and arms were chilly (but it was December).  I am 5'9&#34; and average 3&#34; heels.  The length for me was perfect (about 1&#34; off floor)."}
{"label":3,"review":"I ordered this based on other reviews because I'm always nervous ordering clothes online.  However, the first time I tried to hook the garter straps to a pair of hose, the cheap plastic clip broke so I did not get to wear the hose at all.  Instead, I cut the straps off and just have underwear now.  Also, I normally wear a size 16 and this was pretty tight.  On the plus side, it is long enough to cover my rear so it looks like a cute short dress.  My husband liked it which is the important thing I guess.  I just wish it was a little bigger and that the plastic garter clip didn't break and I would have given it more stars."}

{"label":5,"review":"Bought this to wear under a 1940s suit. The bottom band, if you have a fleshy stomach\/hips, tends to flare out a little, but I wore it underneath a body slimmer and the combination gave my waist tremendous definition while smoothing out all bumps. It's very comfortable, though it does give your boobs a distinct mid-century pointed shape. Because of that I went a cup size down from my usual DD to a D and it fit perfectly. Band size fits as expected. I bought it as a cheaper alternative to the What Katie Did longline bra and I'm so glad I did; it's everything I was hoping for. I'd say it gives medium compression; not too tight and not too loose."}
{"label":1,"review":"These pants were listed as \\\\\"deep purple\\\\\" and the only picture on the site was of the item in black. I imagined a dark, eggplant purple, but they were actually VERY bright. Almost neon. I didn't bother trying them on, so I won't comment on the quality, fit, etc."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love the Magnificent brand! The magnets are brilliant when trying to dress a crying or struggling baby. So easy to use! I found that they (the magnets) are strong enough to keep my baby dressed. I haven't had any issue with them popping open. The print is adorable and the fit is good. Not as soft as I would have liked for my baby but overall a great little product. One problem with the magnets though is throwing these in the dryer. They tend to stick to drum and remain damp. I would recommend air drying if it's not recommended already."}

I couldn't find petite so I bought short, assuming they would be the same.  They're about 3 inches too long, the waist and legs are too large.  I don't know if this is size deflation or they changed the cut and kept the style name.  I gave it 4 stars because they are well-made.  It would have been 5 stars if they fit."}

{"label":3,"review":"I bought one of these in the 'long' size because I was thrilled to find something that would completely cover my torso.  It's nice thick cotton and has good construction, though they do run small.  I was a 34 DD when nursing and the Large was very tight.  Also, in hot weather the good construction is a detriment since having 4 layers of fabric over your chest (which is already hot and uncomfortable) is really unpleasant.  And, you really can see the cutouts through the tank, so it needs to be layered under something.<br \/><br \/>The biggest problem I had was the thin straps were way too flimsy to provide good support.  Glamourmom makes a different kind of tank (called a 'top' I think) that sounds like it would be better.  (Ultimately, I found that the cheap ones from that big box bullseye store were better for me.)"}

The sizing was generous - the shirt is kind of \\\\\"boxy\\\\\" which is exactly what I was hoping for, given that my dad is on the large side and likes his clothes \\\\\"roomy.\\\\\"  The shirt does not cling to him at all and fits very well throughout.  This shirt is high quality -  absolutely worth the price.  Great fabric and print, and all in all a nice shirt with a fun twist.

It says Full Support Stockings, so I took that to mean from waist to toe, but they are only to the thigh, so I wanted to let people know.  They really should put a picture of the actual stockings, not just the package, so everyone knows they are only thigh highs."}

{"label":5,"review":"Over the past few years, I've narrowed down my work wardrobe to a few very nice suits for more formal days, and Dockers top of the line slacks for &#34;business casual&#34; days. Be sure to notice the difference between these &#34;never iron essential&#34; pants and other styles from Dockers -- these truly have a much higher quality feel and finish, resist wrinkling far better, and hold a crease far better (through washings, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Also important to note that Dockers come in a wide variety of combinations of attributes such as: cuffs \/ no-cuffs, fit (slim \/ regular \/ relaxed \/ etc) and overall fabric and construction quality (e.g., &#34;no iron essential&#34;). Be sure to get the right combination, or you may be surprised and disappointed.<br \/><br \/>Over the years, I've shopped at a certain well known bricks & mortar department store to get Dockers. The list price on these is a bit pricey, and retail store's sale price can represent a nice discount. Happily, Amazon Prime pricing is nearly the same -- but you can get these pants ANY time (no waiting for a sale), and unlike shopping at the store, I can simply select the exact pants style, color and size I want and be done. In a retail department store, it can be painful to dig through hundreds (literally) of pairs of pants to find the style, color, size you want -- they simply can't stock enough of every combination to be practical -- but Amazon can in their warehouse.<br \/><br \/>I'm traveling a lot these days for work. Hours in a plane and rental car at least twice a week. These pants will still look fresh after hours of travel, and I can head straight to a client meeting from the airport, and still look crisp and professional.<br \/><br \/>The pants are my favorites for business casual work -- look great with or without a sport jacket. They feel great and wear incredibly well. I can fold them in my luggage, unfold and hang them in the hotel closet at the other end, and they look perfect a few hours later with no need to be pressed.  The buying experience for these is, by far, at Amazon. Great experience all around -- highly recommended. I will NEVER resort to buying these at a bricks and mortar store again!ith no need to be pressed.  The buying experience for these is, by far, at Amazon.

{"label":5,"review":"Super cute gift for a Minnie Mouse birthday party for a two-year old. I was very apprehensive when I first received the outfit because it seemed so small, but the toddler is on the small side (22 lbs at 2 years old). It fit perfectly!"}

{"label":1,"review":"First off, let me say that I'm obviously a adventurous dresser--this probably goes without saying since I ordered this hoodie. The styling is quite unique and could probably best be described as \\\\\"urban wear\\\\\". It will most likely appeal to guys who are adventurous when dressing. Too bad that it isn't made better...<br \/><br \/>The material is synthetic and looks very cheap. I get it, they're trying to keep the price down, but there is synthetic fabric out there that looks and feels much better than this, which just looks completely inorganic--i.e. it looks like something that would never occur in nature. I don't care for fabrics that look like they're manmade. The technology is there to make these fabrics look more natural, but it is not at work here.<br \/><br \/>The other problem for a guy like me who wears about a size 38 jacket is the size of the lapel. For a larger man, this would probably not be an issue, but with all of the Doublju jackets and hoodies I ordered I felt overwhelmed by the sizes of the collars and lapels--they are just esthetically and proportionately too large for a small to medium sized guy. The result was that I looked like I was \\\\\"all collar\\\\\" in the pieces I tried--particularly this one, and the other collared hoodies I tried. It appears that they have not compensated in the design of their smaller pieces by narrowing the collars and lapels to be proportionate, resulting in a rather weird appearance.<br \/><br \/>As I said in the header, the design and fabric quality is reminiscent of the old International Male catalog pieces. It might look good in a one dimensional photo, but it really looks rather cheap when you see it in person.<br \/><br \/>Lastly, the sizes of the Doublju pieces are all over the place. I tried a variety of sizes--some fit, some didn't, and there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to the sizing. A size Large in one style would fit me, while another required an XL, and then a Medium would fit everywhere but in the forearms. I tried this particular hoodie in a size Medium because I like a hoodie to fit me snugly, and it was about the right size, although a little roomy in the body for my taste--except for the collar, which was HUGE! Not a good look.his particular hoodie in a size Medium because I like a hoodie to fit me snugly, and it was about the right size, although a little roomy in the body for my taste--except for the collar, which was HUGE!

{"label":5,"review":"I live in the southeastern part of Louisiana and summers get pretty steamy here.  I wanted a bra to work around the house and yard in and not have it become as uncomfortable as nylon bras.  I think this bra is going to work out well.  I brought this and the one that opened in the front and I much preferred this one.  The one that opened in the front kept coming unhooked and the metal hooks would dig into my skin.<br \/><br \/>This bra is mostly cotton with the back being made of a more nylon or spandex type material.  So, it does have some give with your movements and makes it more comfortable for me personally.  The cups, straps, and front band are cotton and more &#34;breathable&#34; and I hope will not allow pools of sweat to collect next to my skin like the nylon does.  I do not like sports bras and did not want to pay some of the ridiculous prices some are sold for.  I really like this bra for what I will use it for.  I do have to adjust the straps a little looser than I normally wear so that I can have some movement with them since they are cotton and do not stretch.<br \/><br \/>I would not recommend this bra for dressy clothes or someone who has to have full support at all times.  While it supports my size C or D cup figure well enough for working at home or running a few local errands I would not wear it under tight t-shirts or dress clothes where a good support bra is important for proper fit."}

{"label":5,"review":"The skirt works for what I wanted , and it fits very tight and nice."}
{"label":5,"review":"I  don't do a lot of reviews, but I am so enthusiastic about this bra that thought I would add just a couple of comments  to what has already been said in its favor.  I'm in my 60's, large breasted (38D) and active.  I've been looking for a LONG time for a comfortable, truly supportive bra that doesn't squash my boobs together, or give me cone boobs.  (Don't you wish the marketing images of various bras would show a profile view so you could see what the shape of the cup is?)  I've been running in Enells for years, and I still think that a snug Enell is the ONLY bra that holds you absolutely still for running, and honestly I will probably continue to wear the Enell to run in because I don't like any  movement of my breasts at all when I run.  But this bra is really comfortable to wear for any moderate activity, and I think most women that just can't take the Enell would be fine to run in this Champion.  It holds you securely, with good separation (no cleavage rashes from this one) and the shape of the cup is nicely rounded and natural looking and has a minimizing effect which is a plus for me.  The cups are a light-weight fabric, but don't stretch, and don't have that thick padded feel that some do, so the material breathes.  When you put it on, it stays in place - no need for hoisting up on the straps, or pulling it down in back every 5 minutes.  Also - a big one for me - they used a soft thread (not that stiff, awful nylon stuff that pokes into your skin like so many less expensive bras have) and nice fabrics that don't itch and irritate, and the straps are comfortable.  The bra washes amazingly well on a gentle machine cycle and air dries very quickly.  The ONLY negative I would mention is that it IS a racer back, and is a pain to get on and off unless you can hook a bra behind your back (I can't do that anymore).  I just put it on and off over my head - a little difficult if you're damp or sweaty.  But it's worth the trouble.  I've ordered just about every \\\\\"maxiumum support\\\\\" sports bra that Amazon carries, and sent them all back till this one; and these I wear all day, every day.  So I just ordered two more.  AND two of these is about the price of one of most of the others in this category.  Highly, highly recommended!"}

{"label":5,"review":"I'm going to be in two weddings this summer, and one of the brides gave us bridesmaids nearly-free reign over our dresses.  Her only stipulations: Floor-length and plum-colored.<br \/>I have a VERY tight budget right now, and luckily, I stumbled across this dress.  The price is great and has great reviews, however, I was still nervous to purchase it.  I'm only 5' tall, busty and on the chubby\/curvy side, so a floor length dress with a sweetheart neckline displayed on a tall, thin model worried me.  I also didn't care much for the ruching and sequins either.  But after showing it to the bride, who loved it, I went ahead and purchased it.<br \/><br \/>It arrived much earlier than stated on Amazon (a whole week early!), so that was a nice surprise.  It was also shipped properly in a USPS parcel bag housing another small, clear plastic bag with the receipt on top of the dress with the tag still on.<br \/>I tried it on, and it fit like a glove!  The material is very soft and comfortable, and sways beautifully as I walk.  It also thins me out because it's similar to an empire-waist style, and the stitching making the dress slightly pleated in the front, helping me hide my tummy.  Also, with the dress on, the sequins and ruching works with the rest of it, giving it a subtle sparkle whenever I move, and adds some texture against the rest of the smooth fabric.<br \/>The only issues I have with it is the neckline and the length--too low and too long, but fortunately, I have a talented coworker who can hem the dress, then use the extra material to cover up the bust-line a bit more.  If that's not an option for you, it wouldn't look bad to wear a thin tank or tube top underneath.<br \/><br \/>Long story short, I'm extremely happy with the dress, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a simple, affordable, comfortable dress for any formal occasion."}

And I'm a button guy, and all the buttonholes on these were large enough to clear the button nicely. I realize it's possible that not all will be like this depending on what location on earth they're made. This style leans toward \\\\\"young adult\\\\\" but at 66, I'm young enough. The rounded flap edges add a more refined touch too. The twill is a nice weight, not too heavy, and looks to be very durable as long as the stitching keeps it behaving. The color called \\\\\"Cornstalk\\\\\" is my favorite. Wish they could have designed the same appearance into the other colors as well.

They would easily slip off. I remembered I had these and Wa-La - they are perfect for him. He is now 8 months old (20 pounds) and I have ordered 2 additional sets of these, as they are stretchy enough to be comfortable, wonderfully soft, and best-of-all they do not slip off at night.<br \/><br \/>I would rate them 5 stars but for the fact that they are advertised as 0-3 months.

{"label":4,"review":"Very strange gusset ... it's way too big. It comes too far up in the front and back and as a result it's added some extra material that just kind of bunches up. Weird. Other than that they are really comfortable. They do fit a little big so maybe if I tried one size smaller the large gusset wouldn't be as noticeable."}

AFTER READING ABOUT ITEM WE ORDERED IT.  SHIPPED FROM CHINA IT ARRIVED IN ABOUT 15 DAYS.  SHE WASHED IT THEN LET IT DRY.  NOW MY GAL IS SMALL AND PETITE.  AFTER SLIPPING IT ON SHE SPRAYED TABU PERFUME ACROSS HER BREASTS AND PANTY.  LET ME TELL YOU WHEN SHE WALKED INTO THE ROOM SHE HAD MY FULL ATTENTION.  SHE LOOKED STUNNING.  OUTFIT FIT HER PERFECTLY.

It doesn't show it in the photo, but the back where it ties, also has a stretchy headband connector underneath, which helps it fit well and also creates a ponytail hole.

Fast shipping considering that it came from China. The time frame that was given to me was 3-10 thru 3-24 once I ordered.  I ordered on 2\/26 and got it on 3\/9.  The seller's communication was great.  After I put my order through, I remembered that these are Asian sizes and wanted to change my order from a large to and X-large.  The seller got back to me the very next day confirming that they had gotten the message and assured me of the size change.  It came in and everything was exactly what I ordered. Good experience :)"}

{"label":5,"review":"I ordered the 3X after reading other reviews and it fits really nice, probably like a women's XL. I think it will be a nice warm vest for fall and I love that it has a hood for those rainy or windy days since I tend to get ear aches. The smell was a little different but it's summer so I put fabric softener sheets in the pockets and hung it in our covered entryway and now the smell is fine. It seems to be well made."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great fit, very soft and comfortable. The neck is high enough to protect my ankles from getting rubbed raw in my boots, but low enough to wear with sneakers and have minimal show.<br \/><br \/>As for the staying cool factor...

The dress is cute but the zipper is cheaply made and no tags to make sure that you got the right size. I don't believe that this is a 12\/14. Thank God I read the reviews and slipped it on over my head because the zipper would have busted and rip out fringe and it isn't worth it.  It's comfortable to wear for the night and isn't too short."}

He is normally a 32 but we exchanged for a 34. The quality is excellent and the colors are great. Love the look. As for the even exchange, it went seamlessly (although I had to pay shipping costs for the return - not a big issue)... and shipping is much faster than what the dates tell you (2 weeks or so shipping from China). Great product!!!  I ended up ordering 6 pair of the Women's Cargo pant. The cut is definitely more suited for the women's body. --(only reason I tried this man's pant is b\/c other women had claimed the pant fit them well...not sure how that could be as a man's torso is typically longer than womens). Anyhow - great pant - just order the right size."}

{"label":3,"review":"Ordered 4T size b\/c they were about 25% the price of the other sizes.  My kid usually wears 2T.  The top fit fine which makes me think a 2T would have been way too small.  Pants were much too big (as expected).  On arrival, the seam along one leg of the pants had come undone.  Easy to fix, but should not have been the case.  For the price (about 7 bucks) I was happy to fix myself but would have been annoyed if I had ordered a different size at full price."}

{"label":5,"review":"I ordered 5 Port & co. caps, each in a different color.  Apparently they are made by different manufacturers and they seem to all be a bit different from each other.  The royal blue one is the best!  The fabric is the smoothest, the fit is the best, and the details are neatly finished.  A couple of the other caps are literally rough around the edges.  I will get another blue one to save for later."}

{"label":5,"review":"Great jacket!!  I couldn't be more pleased!  I am a big guy, 6'5\\\\\" 290, and it was a real treat to find a size that fits perfectly.  I wear 3XLT shirts and sweaters, so I ordered the 4XLT jacket, which allows me to comfortably wear a sweater underneath.  It's a nice warm jacket without too much bulk.  Very stylish and a great representation of the one my Dad wore as a B-26 pilot in WWII.  Shipping was faster than I expected.  The quality of the leather is just fine, and any stiffness has disappeared after wearing it for a week."}
{"label":3,"review":"I really think that this product is very reasonable for it's price. It looks exactly like the picture and fits pretty well. The only things negative are that the material is very thin. Much thinner than I thought it would be so you have to wear something underneath but all lines from underclothing will stick out of the material a little and any color that is not nude will show through. But I still plan on wearing this to anime expo but probably not for the whole day as I had originally planed since it's so thin. The only other thing is that it had quite a few strings hanging off from the seams . It was a super easy fix but still it was kinda annoying. However this item wasn't overly expensive so It's really not that bad it's just also not that great either ."}
{"label":5,"review":"The measurements are surprisingly accurate. Looks great and is very comfortable to wear, which is surprising for an item this inexpensive. It machine washes fine on a cold water cycle. The stitching around the hole also holds well. I would definitely buy these again."}
{"label":4,"review":"Cute, the band is a little tight though and I thought I heard a thread snap wjen taking off the bra."}
{"label":5,"review":"Really love the skirt. Price was excellent, came promptly.  Fit as expected, waist a little tight, (I wear a 12\/14) but I was expecting that from other reviews.  Skirt itself is very full and flowing, and a perfect length. I've gotten lots of compliments on it."}

{"label":4,"review":"I bought a size 8 because I thought it would be too tight in the waist. I should have gotten a 6 because I usually order a 6.  Six would fit perfectly. It's a nice suit for the price (it was $30.) I just have to return it. (Bummer)"}
{"label":1,"review":"Based on other reviews I ordered XL to be sure that I would fit into these pants and I could barely get them over my hips.  I normally wear a size 10 comfortably.  These pants just run way too small.  Also, I noticed that the band on the top wasn't very sturdy and when I finally pulled these pants on the band slipped to the top of the fabric.  I wouldn't recommend these to any woman."}
{"label":5,"review":"VERY NICE"}

The only not so good about it, it looks cheap quality and too light in weight I do not expected to last long.

{"label":5,"review":"It would be nice to let customer know that the bottoms on the sleeves can't be removed, and offer the length of the sleeves. I was not able to shorten the sleeves and I had to send it to a very expensive Taylor to get it done.<br \/><br \/>Mario"}
{"label":4,"review":"My daughter loves Florida-Georgia Line so she was quite excited when she got this shirt as a gift."}
{"label":3,"review":"The coat and shirt are great but the pants and tie leave something to be desired. The pants feel cheap and have a horrible stretch band waist (like sweatpants). My son regularly wears a size 5 in pants but I had the roll the waist because these were too long. The tie is very short. However, this suit did it's job and I was happy to not spend $100+ on something that my son would quickly grow out of."}
{"label":4,"review":"The white color is ridiculously cute, though I wish it were just a little bigger. It feels like it's sized more for youths rather than adults, but it's such a fun hat, I'm keeping it anyway. Very warm and functional."}
{"label":5,"review":"The bathing suit fits perfect and is so flattering! I love it!"}
{"label":2,"review":"Unlike dockers regular metro pants, which you can buy in Long, Regular or short sizes, the petite metros feel about 2 sizes smaller than your normal size pant.  Say your a size 10 short - if you buy these petite metros, you had better order the size 12 because they are super tight in the thigh area.  Lots of petite folks have curves and these are more like skinny pants.  I do however, recommend purchasing the REGULAR Dockers Women's Metro Trouser with your correct size in either Long, Regular or Short.  Much better fit throughout and you dont feel like your going up a size."}
{"label":3,"review":"Fits weird in the neck and arms area. I bought another shift from them before, same size, and didn't have this issue."}
{"label":4,"review":"Don't listen to all the reviews about ordering up. I'm not sure how consistent this company is but I ordered an XL since most people said it runs small but it's actually too big. I wish I would've gone with my normal medium. This is a great shirt for the price and kind of thick so more for cooler weather."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought this in red (the only color left in my size but pleasantly surprise) before a family trip because I felt uncomfortable in my other one piece, and after having a child I was in no shape for a two piece. I'm large busted and this offered a ton of support and coverage while still being adorable. The necktie did not dig into my skin and nothing was squeezed out of the sides. It covered the stomach area well while still looking cute. I felt confident and comfortable in this...which is saying a lot of any bathing suit. I received a ton of compliments on that trip wanting to know where I got it. I've also worn it to the lake wakeboarding it and stayed in place! Great bathing suit. Well priced. I may be a one-piecer for life."}

{"label":4,"review":"I bought this for my friend's 2 month old at the time and we always get a kick out of corny pictures and jokes. They absolutely loved it. The quality is acceptable and durable enough to last the short timeframe that the kid will fit in it. Recommended"}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought large and medium size gloves assuming that the large would fit me and the medium size would be a Christmas present for my mom.  Instead the large is rather tight on me and the medium is too small for my mom. Unfortunately I could not return the medium size gloves since the purchase date was past the 30 days return policy condition."}

{"label":4,"review":"Four stars bc it was too big for my 1 yr old."}
{"label":1,"review":"Listen to the other reviewers here who have noted that these are fake! Some reviewers have noted the difference in tags, etc - I did not compare the tags on them to my Hues, but I can tell you this:<br \/><br \/>These are definitely fake Hue leggings. They have a shine to the fabric that the real Hue leggings do not at all have (one of the reasons I like Hues -- no shimmer like a lot of cheap leggings have). These had more synthetic material in them causing the shine.<br \/><br \/>They were also longer and waaay tighter (many other reviewers noted fit issues compared to genuine Hues, either much tighter or much bigger). These are lower quality in all aspects.<br \/><br \/>I compared them to my HUEs purchased at Macy's as well as my HUEs purchased at BareNecesseties. These are a different cut, fit and material. Despite the fact that they put them in Hue's packaging, they are complete (and poor) imitations!!! Save your money and go to another retailer for this particular item. I ordered a couple of pairs here at Amazon about a year ago and returned them promptly!! This listing should really be monitored more closely by Amazon."}
{"label":5,"review":"I ordered a bigger size based on the reviews and it was to big for me. I have to return it and get a smaller size. I do love how it looks so looking forward to getting one that will fit me better. So I ordered a 3x when I usually wear 1-2x depending on material. It's a beautiful shirt and fits better."}

{"label":4,"review":"Just what I needed.  Good quality too."}
{"label":5,"review":"Love them. They fit great"}
{"label":4,"review":"Ordered for my husband as a gift.I like the wallet,the leather is nice and seems to be sturdy.The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is that the wallet is smaller in person than it looks in the pictures."}
{"label":3,"review":"Nice bra good quality. I had to send bra back tho cause they were all way too small."}
{"label":1,"review":"If you are curvy and big busted even the large will not fit. It is extremely small and there is a lot of padding."}
{"label":4,"review":"The pants aren't the proper colour but it may just be the fabric. Fits amazing. Everything else is great. I love it!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I use this as a nursing top and love it!  I actually bought a couple and kept one long sleeve and cut off the sleeves of the other so I could wear it in the summer."}
{"label":4,"review":"I like this bra.  However, although it doesn't have underwires, it does have vertical wire stays in the side panels.  Already, these stays are starting to curve.  I have an old Bali bra that did not have those stays and was therefore much more comfortable.  I wish Bali would bring that version back."}
{"label":3,"review":"I like the bras but they are not the same pattern as shown in the picture which was disappointing since that was the main reason I was getting these bras."}
{"label":5,"review":"Fits tight at the waist to show off your assets loose at the knees so you can walk without a problem.Well made with seams at the top and bottom.I thought it would be squeaky to walk in but was quiet.the skirt would be good for costumes or club\/party wear"}
{"label":3,"review":"It is a cute bathing suit cover-up. I would have given it a higher rating except it is a bit shorter than I expected and it always seem to have some serious static cling.  I wish the dress hung more naturally."}
{"label":3,"review":"Had to re-stitch the clasp after 1 month"}
{"label":3,"review":"I returned the item due to somewhat small fit.  I liked the fabric a lot, though.  Felt great against my skin.  Somewhat thick, stretchy, and very soft.  Style ok."}
{"label":4,"review":"it is very high up on your chest but its super cute"}
{"label":4,"review":"This fits properly. Color is also good. Received as expected. The other frock which we ordered along with this is not fitting at all."}
{"label":3,"review":"The skirt fit just fine the length was to long had to have it shorten."}
{"label":4,"review":"Got these during a lightning deal.  My wife loves them and says they are some of the softest and most comfortable pajamas she has ever had.  So, extremely soft and loose fitting.  The fabric has decent thickness to it and the embroidery on the shirt is a nice touch."}
{"label":5,"review":"Good foam clown nose and at a great price. got a dozen for the price of 1 or 2 from some other places. Ended up giving them out to all the kids and they had a great time wearing them."}
{"label":5,"review":"I read in reviews that these jeans run small, so they fit just as I had hoped they would. They are perfect. But usually a size 2 petite is too big for me, so I do believe they run small."}
{"label":5,"review":"excellent product very good size realmene expected to recommend hundred percent satisfied buyers all very good quality it really is published."}
{"label":5,"review":"These pants are great, Levi's doesn't make the 100% cotton version of this pant however.  They have discontinued it.  They all are 99% cotton, 1% lycra."}
{"label":4,"review":"As advertised with quick delivery."}
{"label":5,"review":"I got the green bow tie through my husband\u2019s account. He used it for his Joker costume for Halloween, but it looks nice enough to be used for any occasion. It has an easy-to-fasten clip and is adjustable. It has a nice sheen to it, so the color varies a bit depending on lighting. The little black box and plastic display top are not very sturdy but they keep it protected from being smashed in shipping. We were happy with this purchase."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought this for my friend for Christmas and i hope it made her day, she seemed like she loves it allot so i would recommend it to other people who are looking for a nice Domo style hat. Its also exactly as picture and the seller got it too me in a very timely manner! would recommend! Oh and for people not sure its a adult fitted hat not a snap-back. Good Luck! :)"}

{"label":5,"review":"The most comfortable bra I've ever owned and looks great, too.  I'd highly recommend it!  Love the width under the arms and around to the back--it helps prevent bulging for those of us who are carrying a little extra!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I have been going through competitors Dungaree jeans like crazy because they just don't hold up.  The extra few bucks is definitely worth it because you can see the quality difference as soon as you try these on.  They are heavier fabric and they don't shrink as much either.  I am definitely buying more of these."}
{"label":5,"review":"Love these!!! Bought in every color."}
{"label":5,"review":"They were a little big but that's okay, she'll be able to use them for awhile."}
{"label":5,"review":"Love everything about this!  Color is a true cerulean (rare), pattern exactly right, not overdone, and I wish all these types of dresses would fit as well as this one does.  Thank you!!!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Great shirt for a teen.  Quality and color are there, all that is needed is a tall size."}

{"label":5,"review":"good"}
{"label":1,"review":"Was expecting a woman's xl, instead got a child's size xl. Very disappointed after waiting a month for it, just so it wouldn't fit. Never going to order on line again from amazon."}
{"label":5,"review":"Excellent quality !"}
{"label":1,"review":"I did not believe the existing reviews about the bottom frying and for sure they fried onle after a few days!<br \/>The material is brittle and brakes up even if they are short and do not touch the floor.<br \/>They will deteriorate rapidly even against the shoes.<br \/>Complete waste of money, I wrote to their customer service and I got no answer!"}
{"label":3,"review":"The skull in front is plastic like so makes shirt look thick... Still a nice top w leggings but should prob only wear on chilly days... Too thick for warm weather."}
{"label":5,"review":"Haven't worn it yet but it fits perfect! Can't wait to purchase in other colors!"}
{"label":5,"review":"the dress is beautiful, good brand, fabric is cute too, is simple but fabulous and fascinating details. size I see is slightly smaller than normal, but I guess that is that the model should be rather short. but to all who love and are called much attention this brand and these models."}
{"label":2,"review":"My opinion, you pretty much have to be built like the model in the picture for it to look good."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great hat.  Just what I was hoping for."}
{"label":5,"review":"First I researched what jeans would look best on a petite woman. I found the look and fit exactly to be what I needed."}
{"label":1,"review":"I bought this for our vacation as beachwear.  My daughter put it on and literally 4 minutes later the strap had come loose because it was not sewn onto the romper correctly.  I would make sure to buy something with better reviews."}

{"label":3,"review":"colour faded in just two cold washes otherwise fits good for the fact they are 13 inch in stream  just ok"}
{"label":3,"review":"good material for the for the metal plate frame tag holder looks nice but the bazinga letters are just White stickers on the metal"}
{"label":5,"review":"They are great, but fit a little small . Good quality."}
{"label":3,"review":"These ties look good and are thick - which is a problem for me because of my height.  I'm 6'1 and due to the thickness of the tie, it's too short which is too bad b\/c I loved the construction and design."}
{"label":4,"review":"Purely a novelty item. Cute undies...you can sleep in these, but they are not utilitarian by any stretch. I was just shopping for sleepwear, so I am not disappointed. If you are hoping for cool looking daily wear GnR unders- don't do it! That said, they pretty much are what they look like- cheap, ill-fitting, with what appears to be a non-licensed home screen-print on the front."}
{"label":5,"review":"Order a pair of McGuire-Nicholas 112 2&#34; $8.54 and a pair of John Deere 2&#34; Logger $19.00.  Bought them because I was having a lot of back pain.  Dr. said I was having to wear my belt too tight and to try suspenders. My body shape (up-side-down pyramid) (6' - 270 Lbs) required me to pull my belt pretty tight to keep for sliding down for my fat waist to my smaller hips.  Both suspenders reduce reduced the back pain dramatically.  John Deere was twice the price of McGuire but there are some differences.  Both stay attached to the pants well.  The McGuire are stiffer and the back straps are stretchy; the John Deere are much softer and the entire length is stretchy.  Comes down the costs vs comfort.  I wear both but McGuire requires TeeShit under them."}
{"label":4,"review":"The leather belt is enough long and wide so you don't worry for any somatotype."}
{"label":3,"review":"I thought it was longer but like the fabric and like the color. definitely worth what I paid for but wont be buying snymore"}
{"label":5,"review":"Amazing hat. Almost like being the character in real life."}

{"label":5,"review":"this top is so soft and fits so perfect i lovee love it"}
{"label":4,"review":"The suits are a little bit small, but very cute."}
{"label":2,"review":"Nice belt.  Ordered a 32\\\\\", received a belt that is 44\\\\\" long. It's tagged a small, stamped a small. Quiksilver suggested I order another belt, same size, to 'see' if it would be the correct size."}
{"label":3,"review":"the closing snap came apart but I can put a new one on it I think.  It is very pretty"}
{"label":4,"review":"I get so many compliments and it is extrememly warm. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I am noticing that some of the feathers are already coming out of the coat, but I guess that is to be expected since there are so many :)"}
{"label":4,"review":"The shrug fits well and will go well with summer sleeveless dresses."}

{"label":5,"review":"Good material<br \/>Works fine!<br \/>really light<br \/>works perfect, well ended product<br \/>its just a cap, but is helping me a lot when i m sailing under the sun"}
{"label":2,"review":"Do not go by size chart. The size chart provided is more for little kids. The print itself was nice quality."}
{"label":4,"review":"It came in handy, and on time for the gift I needed for. Thank you guys."}
{"label":2,"review":"The bottoms are not cut like the picture they come up high on the legs a little large."}
{"label":5,"review":"I normally get 32\/34 Levis but got 32\/32 in these carports. they fit just right. I washed them once in cold and didn't notice any shrinkage. The relaxed fit is nice when you're working and have to bend a lot. The extra pockets are handy too. I'll be buying more. I couldn't find these ones in a store, so i'm glad i could find them on amazon for way cheaper than my normal Levis."}
{"label":5,"review":"This shirt is what I was hoping for. It is fitted so you don't end up with all the extra fabric ballooning out around the waist. The wrinkle free actually is pretty hard to wrinkle. The color and fabric have lasted well after a lot of wear even with machine washing and drying. Goes great with slacks or jeans."}
{"label":3,"review":"its ok"}
{"label":5,"review":"kid like"}
{"label":5,"review":"I really like these Champions sweatshirts. The fit is perfect. They wash well without shrinkage or fading and they are warm. Very well made.  These are the best sweatshirts I have purchased in over 20 years.  Buy these with confidence."}
{"label":5,"review":"I like it"}
{"label":3,"review":"The color that was on my computer screen did not match the color of the actual shirt. Since I hate green, I sent it back. It was green - not brown."}
{"label":4,"review":"I purchased one to try and love it.  It is super comfortable and does not ride up.  I an average sized and can get away without a hard core bra.  For a large chested woman, I wouldn't think this would work.  But for me, it is perfect!"}
{"label":4,"review":"It's hard to find cushioned crew socks for women, and these fit the bill. I wear an 8.5 shoe size, and these socks fit snugly, but if my feet were any bigger it might be a problem."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this dress because it fits me just perfectly!  I'm only 5'0, and I got this in a small. I didn't need to adjust the length of it."}
{"label":1,"review":"DO NOT BUY THIS! I bought 3 other henley's with this order, out of those, this one I had to return because the bottom is way too short! When I put it on, it showed my bellybutton!!! It's ridiculous!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Perfect fit!"}
{"label":1,"review":"THIS IS DISGRACEFUL!! Do you know how many of your long time customers are TEACHERS?"}
{"label":5,"review":"I need one in black, also :)"}
{"label":4,"review":"I liked the fit and the look of leather. They give a curvy and uplifting look to my backside and hips."}
{"label":5,"review":"Excellent piece for what it was intended. I love my totes! It serves me well and canvas is exactly what I wanted."}
{"label":4,"review":"I really like this dress, Its very comfortable. Although the skirt part is kinds see through so make sure you wear a slip or something on the bottom."}
{"label":4,"review":"Other than being extra long (hoping that will shrink a little in the dryer) it's comfortable and firs well."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought some shorts thinking a 32 were a good fit, but ended up to big for me. I then ordered these as 32 and the fit was much better. Love all the pockets and really like the black color."}
{"label":5,"review":"This shirt is really nice. As a matter of fact I'm wearing it now! It was broken in when it arrived!! I'm totally satisfied."}

{"label":5,"review":"Great tee shirt"}
{"label":5,"review":"Fits good"}
{"label":5,"review":"I work in the construction industry and always wear these boxers. They are very comfortable and work well to wick the moisture away. I also use them when I run, weight lift and on long hikes. They seem expensive but they are worth the money. I have over ten pairs and only one pair has a waist band that is a little loose after 3 years."}
{"label":5,"review":"I very rarely write reviews (I know I should) but these socks have to be THE best socks I have ever purchased.  True to size and comfy. LOVE that they are mismatched. Do well in the washing machine on cold. Made in the USA, which is one reason I bought them!!!! The shipping was super fast. Will be buying more for gifts!!"}

{"label":1,"review":"Stiff, although it says 100% cotton, it also says \\\\\"made in China\\\\\". Material doesn't breathe; wearing them as a PJ is like wrapping yourself plastic wrap - wet with sweat.  Can't cut them up for use in the garage since they're totally non-absorbent. Salvation Army or Goodwill."}
{"label":1,"review":"For $10 - It should have been made correctly. It's sewn crooked so the back sort of flaps. I will be returning it. Should not have paid more than $3 for this one. And there is no reason to call it &#34;sports.&#34; It a basic visor."}
{"label":4,"review":"The crown is well made and has an excellent quality to it."}
{"label":5,"review":"Amazing dress and it came almost as it is shown in the pictures, i also got another dress from them and it is just as shown, the materials are really good for both dresses, finishing is really good, too<br \/>The most amazing thing is their customer support it is fantastic.

{"label":4,"review":"fit as expected"}
{"label":5,"review":"I have not worn yet.  The material is extremely soft and warm."}
{"label":1,"review":"Amazon pulled a switcheroo on me after I ordered this package of undies.  The photo they showed when I ordered them was of a gray bikini with very minimalist waistband and legband, so that they would be invisible under slacks.  What arrived is an assortment of black, white and magenta bikinis with a striped black heavy duty waistband and legbands -- exactly what I was trying to avoid.  So if you order these, don't order them with the intention of wearing them under slacks, jeans, or tight skirts, because the panty lines are atrocious and the black stripes show through clothes.  Also, the waistband is wide and uncomfortable.  I would return them but I only paid $10 and the brain damage of the return is not worth the effort.  I hate when Amazon does this switching of products.<br \/>By the way, the photo Amazon is now showing for this product is of hipsters -- beware if you think that's what you're getting, because the product they will ship is bikinis with about an inch of fabric around the hips, not the 4 inches the picture shows."}

While I want to help out the coat drive, I don't have a lot money to spend. Every year I find good quality coats for a great price here on Amazon. This coat was a nice coat, the quality was good, the thickness was substantial so I know some child in the Austin area has been warm this winter. Definitely recommend this coat."}

{"label":5,"review":"Great bra for the price! I am really happy with this bra. It wash and wears great."}
{"label":1,"review":"If you are using this product for an occasional event, it will probably be just fine. This product fit as expected.  I wore this product for about two weeks.  It had been just fine for almost two weeks.  One morning while getting ready, the zipper fell apart."}
{"label":5,"review":"It fits as expected. Even on humid days, the fabric breathes and is cool. I am stocking up on these!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great find"}
{"label":4,"review":"I was glad to find these. My son likes to wear them under a button down shirt, while leaving the shirt open. I wouldn't consider these to be long lasting but will get him through one season.<br \/><br \/>I do recommend them. They have worked well for us for the past few years."}
{"label":5,"review":"This Bra fits very well."}
{"label":5,"review":"Honestly is underpriced,this wallet from calvin klein is nice!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love cats and The Big Bang Theory, so this shirt was an obvious choice for me. I was a little concerned after reading other reviews that this shirt would be thin or shrink terribly when it was washed, but it was actually very good quality and fit true to size. I did not notice much shrinking after washing in cold water and a hot dryer, which was a pleasant surprise. The shirt is actually heavier than most of the \\\\\"junior fit\\\\\" t-shirts that I own. The shirt is very comfortable. I usually wear a thin tank top underneath, but I don't think it would be required. I recommend this shirt to anyone who love TBBT like me!"}
{"label":2,"review":"I ended up with 2 of the same men's wallet but 2 different prices one for $28 (tax included); the other for $76. I'm very disappointed because I did not like the &#34;tri-fold&#34;  style."}
{"label":2,"review":"I ordered one med and it came in too small and the zipper broke.  Then ordered a large and the zipper broke.  This is a poorly made costume.  And also the large barely covered my C cup.  I would not suggest this costume to anyone until they use a regular zipper and not a plastic one."}
{"label":5,"review":"This bathing suit is perfect.  It's so flattering!!  I was nervous about the &#34;cheeky&#34; cut of the bottom - but it is such a cute cut.  It's also extremely well made and worth the money.  I am 5' 2&#34; and about 115 lbs.  I ordered a Medium and it fits perfectly (so this suit does run on the small side.  I ordered the medium based on other reviews).  I can't say enough - it's just super cute.  Probably my favorite suit!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great hat, works well with my suits. I am very pleased!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I train heavy in the gym and these are probably the most comfortable pair of shorts I own. I wear a size two or four around my waist and the medium fits comfortably. I'm very happy with this product and will be purchasing many more pairs!"}

She is a little small for her age (12 pounds @ 5 months) so it's slightly big on her but not too big for her to wear and be warm and plenty warm she is. If you leave it on her bundled in the carseat on a longer drive it's warm enough she gets a little sweaty. Would def recommend :)"}

{"label":2,"review":"This bra didn't fit me correctly compared to other Fantasie bras. The center piece fell forward, which is unsightly. I ended up returning this item and purchases items from a different brand. Good bras in these sizes are hard to find and require a great deal of trial and error (mostly error)."}

{"label":4,"review":"When I opened this sweatshirt out of the package, I LOVED it! I love the Gildan brand of sweatshirt, the printing seemed really great, and its a bit bigger than my size which was expected and I like that style anyway. (I'm a size S) The only thing that I didn't like and that bumped my rating down a star was that there was a wrinkle in the fabric at the bottom that was printed over, and when I slipped it over my head to try it on, it separated. So the C in California looks weird, but other than that its AWESOME! I do recommend."}

{"label":4,"review":"The baby kangaroo came out on Halloween but my daughter loved the costume. Gave it 4 starts because of this. Could have had better stitches."}

{"label":4,"review":"These are some of the best work pants I have tried so far.  Long term wear protection will have to be revisited but so far so good.  I have tried Dickies, Carhartt, 5-11 Tactical, ect.  These are on par and possibly exceed premium Carhartt work pants.  I work in the fabrication\/repair field and am welding, grinding, and wrenching all day.  I am on my knees, crawling under machines all the time.  The ripstop fabric is durable, yet light enough for warm weather work.  Double knees, and double stitching add extra protection as well.<br \/>I have nothing bad to say so far about these pants, especially at the $30ish price.  As I said, long term durability are yet to be seen, so I only gave 4 stars, but it looks promising."}
{"label":5,"review":"Just got this mask and good for a halloween party or go to a wwe event. Awesome, I Love it."}

{"label":1,"review":"Frankly I'm flabbergasted at the positive reviews here. The only thing that adequately explains it is they must be written by teenaged girls. If I were 12, hell, even 15, I would love this sh*t. As an adult with a permanent kid's brain, however, tempered by death and taxes, though this army shirt seems skully cool, it is pure communist labor camp crap. It arrived with a hole in one of the pockets, and when I unbuttoned it, one of the snaps flew off off it wholesale, leaving a torn gap in the front placket of the shirt. The skull appliqu&eacute; is so precariously applied that, again, it's like a school-night crafts project one did in junior high.Also, it is not a jacket, not water-proof or resistant in *any* way (a quick spritz with a water bottle will prove this), and if you have truly passed puberty without dieting or having been an athlete, it does not fit around proper breasts, nor fall anywhere below your waistline (the picture is zehr deceptive).<br \/><br \/>Please let me suggest better skullwear. I purchased a coolio sarongy on Amazon [1 World Sarongs Womens Skull Swimsuit Cover-Up] in blue & white and I use it as a shoulder cover, scarf, hip adornment and skirt! And being rayon, it really is water-resistant."}
{"label":2,"review":"I loved these socks because they don't show with heels or even flats that are cut low on the sides. These are also thicker than the Hue socks, which were more like thick nylon\/thin tights material, and didn't show\/slip around like the Hue socks. I wear an 8 and the small fit perfectly- not stretched too tight, but not loose enough to show\/bunch up. However, after washing and wearing a pair for the second time, a large hole formed over the toe. It's a huge disappointment because I liked these a lot, but for the price of $7\/per sock, I don't think it's worth buying more packs if they are going to require time-consuming darning after every other wear."}
{"label":5,"review":"Perfect fit"}

{"label":5,"review":"I absolutely LOVE this cardigan. It's lightweight, and thin, perfect for summer, and nice to have to wear to my job in a refrigerated warehouse. It super soft! Fits in all the right places and hangs just like I had hoped! Very pleased!<br \/><br \/>I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."}

{"label":3,"review":"its ok for the price paid"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is darling on my little girl. I ordered the 6-9 month size although she is only 4 months and rather petite for her age. The tag says 9 months but fits her more like a 3-6 month outfit. I wish it came in larger sizes because it really is so cute and feminine."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great product, fits perfect."}
{"label":4,"review":"I'm 6'4 and the XL size fits fine.  Shrinks somewhat in the dryer but what do you expect, its cotton.  Wish there was a choice for 4-pack of 1 solid color, instead of the mix and match."}

{"label":5,"review":"I can't even explain how gorgeous this dress is. The picture does no justice. I had seen this dress in store and they only had a size 2 with no availability to order any:-( Amazon saved me because they literally had one size 4! And it fits perfectly! I'm not normally a size 4 I don't think. I wear 4-6 in lucky jeans. I'm 5&#34;6 and 145 lbs, athletic build. I wear a 34DD bra size and this dress fits like it was made for me. The customer service I received from Amazon was the best. I will always be a loyal customer!"}

{"label":5,"review":"This is such a cute little top!! It will look great as a cover up or even if you had this over a crop top or cute bra with some jeans. Fits loosely but not falling off. I think this could fit on mostly all body types. Really looking forward to summer so I can wear this!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Lovely scarf!"}
{"label":5,"review":"LOVE IT"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this bra it is amazing!! It is super soft and the price was great!! I got a 34D but normally I am a 32D-32DD, so naturally the cup is a little small and I have to hook it on the smallest hook, but that was to be expected. This bra is high quality and it looks very cute."}
{"label":5,"review":"My son uses this while hunting to wrap around face. Nice size and not scratchy.  I'm sure he will want more soon."}

I'm not sure if I could wear these out but they're thick enough to wear out in public and they're not see through so I guess you can wear them out in public. I recommend anyone looking for a pair of nice yoga pants these are the ones to get trust me buddy. Oh yes I'm going to be buying a few more pairs because this is very comfortable and nice.  after a week of having this product the crotch of it opened up so yes this is not recommended, but the crotch popped open."}

{"label":5,"review":"This is a fine product at a very good price. I use this as the foundation for the new &#34;Steve Jobs&#34; (kind of) way I dress. As a big guy I like the way it fits and how comfortable it is. The collar or neck stays put like it should which you can't say about other such garments. I plan to buy more of these."}
{"label":4,"review":"These are good winter time sweaters for me.  They are warm and lose enough for layers underneath.  The v neck is low enough to show off some shirt and a tie if you wish."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good product and durable. My son loves them."}
{"label":5,"review":"It was exactly was I was looking for. A briefcase that was not too big or too small. I can fit my 13\\\\\" laptop in it and still have a lot of space left. but travel on the bus carrying it in my hand.    Also very good price."}

{"label":5,"review":"i love it"}
{"label":4,"review":"Pros: This is a lovely style and print that looks good on a larger figure. I was very happy with the sizing (I found it true to size) and overall fit. The vibrant colors form a nice pattern that make coordinating and accessorizing very versatile: there are three shades of gray, black, white, fuchsia, a sort of wine\/burgundy, a more purply fuchsia shadow, and a more scarlet\/true red tinge.<br \/><br \/>You may want a completer jacket or sweater since it is sleeveless, and be sure to wear the proper foundation garments since jersey can be unforgiving with hip or tummy bulges...but on the other hand, this is a great style and pattern to camouflage *A LOT*!! ;-)<br \/><br \/>The tie stays tied and there is a hidden tab with two buttonholes to keep the internal wrapped front in place (adjustable fit, yea!).<br \/><br \/>Cons: I found, like other reviewers, that the ruffled collar tends to pull out or turn down the neck edge where the ruffle is attached, so that you can see the seam overlock\/serged stitching (and thus the tag even flipped outward), and the collar ruffles themselves are likely to flip over so that the underside of the fabric shows. The collar ruffle also does not have a finished outer edge, but rather just has the raw cut edge of the fabric, so you probably will definitely not want to try machine washing it. Jersey doesn't fray much but I am thinking that it will look fuzzy pretty fast. Because of these three cons about the ruffle, while I have worn it with the collar as is, I am considering whether to attempt to alter the dress so that there is no collar.<br \/><br \/>When I tried on the dress the first time, the button threads came loose and I lost the inner button, but that was an easy repair-- this could have been a mistake with just the one particular dress, but let my experience serve as a warning to you to check the sewing before wearing.<br \/><br \/>All things considered, I got a really good deal so consider your cost per possible wear and go from there."}
{"label":1,"review":"What a rip off. Like most of these types of lingerie products, they are just super cheaply made. The product does NOT look like it does in the picture and when I got it it didn't fit correctly at all (I am a smalll, extra small in many brands, and this was still tight in the waist and loose in the legs). Even though this is really just a \\\\\"fun\\\\\" product, you still want it to be somewhat functional or at least of decent quality and this was neither. The elastic didn't even stay attached to the fabric. Seriously just a huge huge rip off."}
{"label":5,"review":"I use skate style shoes, and this socks fits and feel very confy. They are true to the size. I recommend them."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great dress for all different body types! I bought 4 of these dresses in different colors for me bridesmaids. My sister tried her's on and loves it! I'm still waiting on the other three to come in so the rest of my girls can try them on. Overall, good quality, great prices, lots of color options. I would defiantly recommend!!!<br \/><br \/>** I just wanted to add that the customer service that Von Vonni offers is beyond what I expected. They really do care about their customers and provided me with amazing customer service which just make me want to buy more products from them! Kudos to you guys!**"}

{"label":1,"review":"I used to LOVE this style carhartt  and have 3-4 pairs that have survived HARD daily wear for 8-9 years, and are in need of replacement due to a waist line expansion.  The old ones were assembled in Mexico by cloth manufactured in the U.S. Long story short, the old ones were worth the premium I paid for them.<br \/><br \/>THESE NEW ONES ARE HORRIBLE!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!<br \/><br \/>Firstly, let me speak of the fabric.  It is A LOT thinner than it used to be, and not as heavy duty.  I doubt these will survive a decade like the old ones.  They attract lint like a magnet, I do t even want to wear them.  As well, the sizing is HORRIBLE!  I bought 36x36, as the old ones I have fit well in the waist but are a little short in the leg.  These on the other hand are like CLOWN PANTS.  I had JNCO skater jeans that were less baggy than these things.  Oh yeah, and they came @ least 7 inches longer than the old pair of 36 length ones that I have.<br \/><br \/>I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO MY WORST ENEMY!<br \/><br \/>If I were to do this purchase over, I would buy 2 pairs of wrangler 936, WHICH FIT PERFECTLY IN THE SAME SIZE, for the same price that I paid for this one pair of Carhartt.<br \/><br \/>Carhartt really cut corners by having these pants made entirely in MEXICO, and it shows; NEGATIVELY!<br \/><br \/>THEY JUST LOST ALL FUTURE BUSINESS FROM ME!"}

Very thin, cheap fabric of the very lightest pink -- much paler than the photo.  Returning to seller in China costs more in postage than the item.  Will be giving it away."}

{"label":3,"review":"ok"}
{"label":4,"review":"Beautiful, but had an opening in the upper neck."}
{"label":5,"review":"I gave these to a slim 76 year old guy with slim hips so belts don't work very well for him. He likes these suspenders a lot, says they're comfortable, easy to adjust, and the clasps work just fine. They look good with a shirt tucked in. He also wears them under t-shirts and sweatshirts and says they're comfortable on his bare skin. He prefers them to a belt and wears them every day."}

{"label":4,"review":"this was a great wig it fit great and was perfect for our 70s party"}
{"label":3,"review":"Over all the socks are decent quality. But I purchased them because due to certain health issues, I deal with a lot of fluid retention in my feet and ankles, and was hoping for a sock that would fit loosely around the ankle instead of binding and cutting. These aren't bad, and if all things were normal for me, I'd probably like them a lot better. It's not really the fault of the sock."}

{"label":3,"review":"On the plus side, this headband has a little more 'bun bulk' than the wig that comes with the complete costume packages and the color is decent.  It is also shipped with hairnets over the buns which keeps them tidy and arriving in good condition.<br \/><br \/>On the negative side, well, mostly it's about the headband.  It's not likely to blend with your natural hair and it's not adjustable which means you can't put the buns where they belong.  Also, the buns are held a bit off the head so they stick out at unrealistic angles over the ears.<br \/><br \/>At this point, with the party coming up, I'm trying to figure out if it's worth trying to remove the buns from this to add to the wig that came with the outfit....lets face it, those were some mighty big head buns in the movie and it would be nice to have that with the costume.<br \/><br \/>All in all, this is not so great, but better than the alternative in some ways.  Oh well.  Next year I'll try to plan ahead earlier and shop in person.  Or do something clever that does not require anything I can't make for myself.

Surprisingly I had a call come in while riding and I thought, hey these don't have a mic do they?

I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the zipper. It didn't break or anything but it is hard to zip up and unzip and you need to be careful with it. It will arrive wrinkled- I used a steamer on it with no issues. I ordered the blue and it was a gorgeous color! I got several compliments on the dress. I am thrilled that I ordered this dress and glad to have it on hand should I need a formal dress to wear last min again. The fit was great and the fabric was beautiful. You really can't beat the price on this dress!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this pair of tights. It's by Hue and I love their reputation with leggings. This pair is not too thick, just opaque enough to give that sexy hue on the legs. They fit nicely around the legs, soft (not itchy), and does not lag in the crutch. I'd say I'm a tall person (5' 10&#34;) and often tights lag for me and every now and then I have to adjust the fitting around the legs to make room for crotch fit. These need no adjusting, once snuggly on. They also feel very comfortable all day long. Love them!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Perfect for the wedding!!! I bought these for the groomsmen and the fit was just right. Went to Mens Warehouse to try a jacket and the fit was the same."}

{"label":4,"review":"I ordered this suit on May 6th for a trip to the beach in June. I was a little worried about it arriving on time, since it wasn't scheduled to arrive until June 18th at the latest, but I had it by May 16th! After reading the other reviews, I order a size larger than I normally would. I am pear shaped, and the bottoms fit perfectly! The top, however, is enormous. It needs to be taken in, or the first wave that hits me will take the top with it. The suit is comfortable and cute, and I'm super excited to wear it!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I've been looking for a good pair of leggings for awhile but have been very skeptical about buying them online. I decided to take a risk and buy these after reading the positive reviews about them and it was 100% worth it! I was worried that they would be too thin and see through but I have no problem with these. Shipping was prompt. Definitely will be buying a few more pairs!"}

{"label":3,"review":"For $20 I was excited it said it was cashmere - but when I got it - it just didn't feel as cashmere-like as I was hoping for. The winters are cold here in Minnesota, and too often are headbands like these ichy and not very warm. I'm returning it based on how it feels - but I can't speak to testing it in the cold. It's just not what I was hoping for. It does seem decently made - so it's okay, again just not what i wanted."}

{"label":5,"review":"The hat is good quality for the price, not thin at all like other cowboy hats I have read about on Amazon.It was felt hat that is thick and was package very well that it did not get crushed during delivery. It looks better than the picture. It actually works really well for women too I think being that the hat is not too tight on my head (I have average head I think) so my hear does not get flat from wearing this. Very comfortable around the head too. I bought an (elope) sheriff badge that I put on the hat and it looks perfect. My son is going to use this for a wild west event and this fits the bill. I bought the read bandana somewhere else in store. Looks great and does not hurt the pocket book -- what's not to love?"}

{"label":5,"review":"Cute & comfy! Love these pants! Fit very relaxed but you can dress them up with the right top & shoes."}

{"label":5,"review":"Such a cute little robe for my daughter."}

{"label":4,"review":"Fin runs small but we loved the tail"}
{"label":5,"review":"Good quality, shipped as expected. The box they come in is sturdy enough to serve as their daily-use container."}
{"label":2,"review":"I wear a size 10 shoe, so I got the larger size of these. They constantly slip off which is very annoying. The smaller size may have worked better, but I don't want to chance buying another set."}
{"label":5,"review":"I loved this outfit. It was really cute. It fit somewhat small though, it wouldn't go over my daughter's head so I had to stretch the seam a bit. The pants are a little long for a one year old even if she is quite tall. Overall it was great!! I love mud pie clothing."}
{"label":3,"review":"Honestly, I bought these because I was feeling a little 80's nostalgia and wanted to buy some Gotcha shorts like I had when I was a kid.  These are a little junky though.  I probably wouldn't bother buying them again.  They are made out of extremely thin material and just don't really feel like they're very good quality."}

{"label":1,"review":"This dress is short like a long shirt.It does not even have a tag in it to what size how its made or what it is made of.It is the color that shows.It is cheap made and material.I would not buy it!!.I threw my 2 dresses that I ordered in the trash I wouldn't even give the long shirts to no one."}

{"label":5,"review":"the material is light, but it will be good for summer."}
{"label":5,"review":"I got this top for vacation and got compliments non stop. The color is amazing and the fit was perfect. I must say that if you plan on doing a lot of swimming the fringe will get stuck in your clevage but other than that i LOVE this suit. I only used the top piece not the bottoms. Bottoms are verrry small for my taste but still great quality."}
{"label":4,"review":"looks good so far"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love these pants and have even gifted them twice!  We get many compliments on them."}
{"label":3,"review":"I loved my costume. The dress was true to size but the belt was too big, and the ears kept falling backwards. I had to alter a few things, but i made it work."}
{"label":5,"review":"I have used the Munsingwear kangaroo pouch for the past 15 years but noticed the pants and material quality has dropped quite a bit as its manufacturing sites moved around the world.  I tried the Jockeys based on their design and product reviews and find they do the job and seem to be made of a much better quality cotton."}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice"}
{"label":5,"review":"Very cute, good material, good price."}
{"label":4,"review":"I like the sweater and it can be worn with all types of outfits. Its longer in the front and shorter in the back. I tie mine in a bow in the back when i dont want to tie the strings in the front. I'm taller, so I guess my arms are a little longer, but the sleeves arent long enough on me, but i usually just bunch them up by me elbows."}
{"label":5,"review":"Fantastic fit and feel"}
{"label":2,"review":"I ordered a 14 for my 11 year old daughter. She's not a &#34;skinny jean&#34; build kind of girl so the size14 was fine. The sweater\/knit fabric makes it fit snug. Note the length in all sizes is the same (28&#34;) so the older and taller a child gets, the &#34;shorter&#34; the dress becomes. If I only  had to comment on the visual appeal of the dress I would have rated it higher. However, I had to sew up no less than 4 holes along various seams, some of which were quite large. Had my daughter not needed the dress the day after we received it, I would have sent it back for this poor quality issue."}
{"label":4,"review":"Fits just great"}
{"label":5,"review":"I won a costume contest, nuff said."}
{"label":2,"review":"i like the shirt But didn't realize it was.... DRY CLEAN ONLY"}
{"label":4,"review":"I really liked the hoodie but it was smaller than I expected.  I thought I was buying it one size larger but it barely fit.  The next time I will get it 2 sizes larger"}
{"label":5,"review":"Fits true to size. I was blown away by the quality and the fact you get all the accessories.  If you bought everything separate at a Halloween store you would be paying way more $$$. Costume was a hit and I would definitely recommend ordering this costume!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Love it! Love the material!"}
{"label":4,"review":"An OK item for free! I would not of paid what they want for it plus shipping, but since it was FREE, i'm ok with it.(The cooler is the BEST in my opinion)It's kind of a thin towel, but if i want a heavy towel, i'll go to wal-mart & get one for $10."}
{"label":5,"review":"Really good fit.  Washes well.  Will definitely reorder."}
{"label":5,"review":"This bag has enough room for my hefty 13 inch laptop plus a few books.  It's not too heavy and is pretty easy to get around.  I really like it!"}
{"label":5,"review":"It does run small so buy big. I did and this is the best fitting bikini I own!"}
{"label":5,"review":"This bra surprised me in a good way. I bought it to try when I'm outdoors doing yard work and gardening. It is surprisingly comfortable and it actually lifts with separation. Previous &#34;sports bras&#34; I've worn smooshed me and made more of a uniboob. I think I typically wear a 36 C... and bought a medium which is a bit tight in the band but I've gained weight so I'm probably bigger around than I want to admit. I bought 2 more colors to wear even under work clothes.  Note the picture, this bra comes up fairly high and shows above some tops but no different than a tank appearing under a top. I'm glad there are some pretty colors because of this."}
{"label":5,"review":"I got this dress and loved it!!! The shipping was also faster than I expected. Love it!!!!"}
{"label":5,"review":"nice"}
{"label":5,"review":"It is gourgeous, my daughter looks very preatty. It is confortable and cute. Excellent product, the fabric, color and designs are very nice. She loves it."}
{"label":2,"review":"I love the look of the shirt, but they are at least three sizes too small. I am 5'10 and weight 178 pounds and normally wear a medium\/large. I ordered XL and these shirts were extremely tight fitting, which is not the look I was looking for. I could barely squeeze into them. Also the sleeves were very short. I returned and considered ordering an XXL, but felt those would probable be too small as well. If they made these in US sizes I would definitely buy. Only buy if you are slim and prefer your clothe to fit like a tight glove."}
{"label":5,"review":"cute hat for the money"}
{"label":5,"review":"I've been blessed with many things and one of them was having an arm like a rocket. Let me tell you about this costume, this costume was the the hit of the party and not because I'm awesome but because kenny powers goatee and wig were on point. Good job amazon"}
{"label":5,"review":"As far as I'm concerned if you use the size chart it will fit awesome. My wife was very happy with it because it fit perfectly."}
{"label":2,"review":"I'm returning this hat - the hat is cute but once it sits on your head it loses all appeal. The brim is too wide and floppy, it's hard to see unless you're looking down at something."}

Used them in a 32 mile ride worked well. ave. 16.1 mph best time I had with these compression bike shorts with a 17 mile first hour and on the bike and then got off the bike for 5 mins.  then finished the rest 32 miles in 2 hours wow these really helped."}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice thin dress sock, just wish they were a bit longer."}
{"label":1,"review":"This dress is way too small! I ordered a 3XL based on the sizing chart but the dress is more like a medium or large. It is also extremley transparent all over, not just the lace on the arms and chest. This product can't be returned so now I'm just out the money :("}

{"label":1,"review":"The WORST product ever I would NEVER buy from this again !!!! Sizing don't add up such a waste of money"}

{"label":2,"review":"Material is a bit thin. Took a while to arrive."}
{"label":5,"review":"I've been looking for a comfortable full-fitting panty for a long time and I finally found it! Super comfortable and no elastic &#34;tattoos&#34; around my waist and thighs.  The hem at the openings is a little wider than most making these panties super comfortable to wear.  I think I've finally found one I'll stick with.  I highly recommend these to anyone!"}

I ordered size 5T, sizing was right on target (not large or small).<br \/><br \/>The exterior seems quite waterproof, the interior is mesh but with smooth sleeves to make getting it on easier. Very lightweight. Exactly what I was looking for.<br \/><br \/>I'm very pleased with this jacket and so is my little guy!"}

{"label":5,"review":"After reading the other reviews, I ordered an XL. I regularly wear M\/L and am a 36C. With that said, I really like the way it fits and the XL is perfect. The fabric is thin, sheer and flows well. It's a perfect complement to sleeveless dresses.<br \/><br \/>The only drawback I have found is that while wearing a more &#34;slippery&#34; fabric underneath (e.g. rayon, silk), the shrug will NOT stay in place and rides up over the breast area. Next time, I'll wear some fabric tape with it to be sure it stays put."}

My fingers moved of their own volition, I was a passive participant watching the letters appear before me. \\\\\"The Mountain Mens Wolf Flag Short Sleeve Tee\\\\\".<br \/><br \/>As the page loaded I heard a rumble, as if from afar. All at once a brilliant light rushed forth and an explosion blew me backwards out of my chair.<br \/><br \/>I arose from the floor adorned in this majestic t-shirt - a new man, a better man, filled with the light and fury and wisdom of the great American wolf spirits for which this shirt is a blessed vessel."}

This bra creates an attractive shape, adds lift without creating too much cleavage, looks great under clothes. It's not a sexy bra, but to me, for every day, it's more than worth it in comfort and knowing it looks nice. I recommend!!"}

{"label":4,"review":"Everyone who saw my son thought he looked very cute and knew without a doubt that it was his baptism day. My mother-in-law loved the little bowtie on the shirt. He only wore the hat on the way to the church, and we probably could have done without that accessory all together. My boy wore the large size (9-12) months though he was only 6 months old (weighed just over 18 lbs). May be a little pricey (as far as baby clothes are concerned) for something only worn once, but it is an important day! I was happy with the result! <br \/> <br \/>One thing I will add: I ordered the expedited shipping, but it took 2 days longer than it should have, and I was afraid it wouldn't show up in time. I recommend ordering at least 2 weeks prior to the christening."}

Never expected that, quite a plus, little to no shrinkage in washing and this is not a thin cheap cotton either, it has a nice weight to it, very nice for those of us in menopause, highly recommend!"}

It even came in a very nice box, which was unexpected. I would definitely purchase again."}

OHHH, I'd rather go Walmart next time."}

These pants are very soft and have been perfect for my baby during 3-5 months so far. My baby is pretty chubby so if your baby isn't, then these may run big. Some brands you have to order a size up, but not with Under the Nile. Their clothes are true to size with a little room to grow. They wash (TONS OF TIMES) and wear nice and I've ever had any problems with any of their products. I ordered these footie pants in light blue and also green. I pair them with the Under the Nile baby tees in matching colors and my baby looks adorable! Super cute baby clothes : ) LOVE that they are organic and no harsh dyes are used!"}

First off, I also only got one pair of shorts (I would think it was a Vine issue, but I see others who are not Vine reviewers have had the same problem!); and as you can see in photos that others posted, they fit very geeky. They were perfect around the waist on my slim son; and slightly snug in the butt; and then loose or just bunchy and weird around the front and leg.<br \/><br \/>On top of it the fabric is CHEAP.  Really cheap.  I just can't recommend these at all.<br \/><br \/>The ONLY way I would recommend them is if you can't afford much else... they are better than Wal-Mart but not by much... and ONLY worth it if you actually get two of them in the pack.  Then yes, they would be totally worth it.  But only if your ONLY concern is value!"}

The one I bought for myself was supposed to be a beautiful shade of very light aqua. It came as a very dark green teal. Nothing like the picture it shows on my order. I'm trying really hard to make myself like them despite of the mishaps. They would probably discount the return too much and make me pay shipping.

{"label":4,"review":"I have purchased two of these pants.  I wear a size 8 jean and bought the mediums and a pair of the large.  The large are too big in the waist and are a lot less flattering due to too much fabric.<br \/><br \/>I have had these for a year, have cycled through three pair that I just keep washing.  I use them at the gym for weight lifting almost daily as well as lazy pants with a tshirt and a jean jacket.  I wash them in the washing machine on cold with detergent and then I follow them in the dryer on low heat.  There is no pilling, no holes.  There MAY be a bit of shrinkage on length due to putting it in the dryer, but Im 5'6\\\\\" and its not really noticable due to the length of the pant before drying.<br \/><br \/>The biggest plus for these is the fact that they dont show sweat.  None. I am a huge sweat-er, as in major swamp-a$$, and these don't show a thing.  This is a huge plus for me.<br \/><br \/>The one downside that I do find with these is that I dont care for the fold-over waistband.  it is less flattering and gets a bit loose when I sweat in them.  If they just made a wide waistband that didnt pinch rather than a foldover I would be purchasing several more of these. As a side note, I have heard people who have xtra skin in the abdominal area say that it is a flattering fit due to the looseness, so if that is your problem area this may be for you.  I want to highlight a flat belly rather than add bulk\/hide."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great visor for wearing when you need total coverage. It covers my entire face.  I feel as though I have my own personal umbrella.  Easy to roll up.

{"label":5,"review":"I have two young grandsons that started using the potty by age one and a half. They were totally out of diapers by that age and sadly, most toddler clothes are made to accomodate bulky diapers and even most available undies are quite bulky.  These undies fit correctly and make the boys feel really great and they like them so much they don't want their pants back on. They want to show off their dinosaurs! The colors are very attractive as well. These are the perfect soze for little boys between the age of one and two. The undies are also very soft. I am not sure about absorbency since they are like real underwear, not training pants. Just what we needed for these little guys and I really think it has helped them in potty training because they don't WANT to wet these undies.<br \/><br \/>It took a couple weeks for the package to arrive since they came straight from Korea, but I am certainly glad we decided to give them a try. Best undies we have found!"}

It came quickly and in a reusable bag that the jacket can be stored in. The colors were very vivid and when I handed the bag to my husband, he got a huge smile on his face. This jacket is pretty close to the outfits in the game series and make a great starting layer for a costume or a fan of the game to wear while they play (if they're that serious). It seems to be very well made and sturdy. I don't know if I would suggest trying to recreate some of the scenes in the game while wearing this jacket, but I think it'll hold up well. The only downside is that the shoulders are a little tight. I ordered an Extra Large (41.5-43 chest) and it still seems a little tight on my husband; so order a little larger than normal. Other than that this jacket it great and my husband can now run around the house acting like an assassin.<br \/><br \/>I purchased this product at a discounted rate in return for my unbiased review."}

{"label":3,"review":"I ordered this in white but was VERY disappointed because it's not a true white but more like an off-white. Because of the off color, I can't use it for what I originally purchased it for but it's versatile enough to use for other things.  I did like the fact that the back is cut in a V shape at the neckline.  Since it seems like the fabric is cut on the bias, the top fits slightly off to the side but that could be just because I have a very full bust area. The rest of the fabric is cute A-Line and is  flowy with a lot of movement. It's very sheer and more light weight than what I expected but it's well made. The size is what I expected as I wanted something a little on the larger size.  If you want something tighter fitting, order a size down from your true size. I'm a little over 5ft and the back hits me at the back of my knees while the front is a couple of inches above the knee. I'm also very curvy and this does flatter my shape. I would've given it 5 stars but that color is so off..."}

Last year, JcPenney stopped making the Ambrielle full coverage and slightly padded bras that I had been buying for years, and they were one of the few brands\/styles that came in 32D an gave me the shaping I loved.  This bra is not padded, but it is so comfortable, it will be my replacement.  Just have to watch yourself in the cold since it's not padded if you KWIM.

They look stylish not like childrens<br \/>leggings or something senior citizens wear (I'm just saying) if you've got a boyfriend or husband who's a joker, he can't say<br \/>they're not for you-- unless he hates red or leggings.

I had to get 3 sizes up for this shirt because the material looked like it would show some \\\\\"fat\\\\\". I tried the shirt on and it fits nicely however I was right about the fat part. If you are a little thicker you wouldn't want to buy this shirt. It will show all of your stomach if it doesn't lay flat. I was also shocked how Small it was when I got it out of the bag it was in. It's not as long as I pictured. I am not sure if the other customer's got the beads on the dress in WHITE, but mine came in BLACK. I think the black beads add on to it though. But I would have liked the white beads because that's what I paid for. None the less the shirt is REALLY cute and dressy. I'd rate it a 4.5 if I could."}

{"label":4,"review":"I've had this belt for just shy of a year now and for the most part love it.  I'm only giving it three stars for two reasons, however.    The first reason is that the actual belt part cracked within the first couple months of ownership.  To their credit, the company issued me a replacement immediately and had me send the cracked belt back on their dime.  The replacement belt has yet to have any issues.    My biggest complaint is the buckle.  To be specific, the buckle falls off ALL THE TIME.  Not while I'm wearing the belt, but if it's on my pants and I pick them up to carry them to the bathroom, the buckle regularly just falls off.  Over the past year I've just cut the belt back a little bit at a time and let the buckle bite down on a \\\\\"new\\\\\" section and that solves the problem for a little while. But, it's clearly not a long term solution.    There is a bonus to having it so easily removable though, and that's going through metal detectors.  Instead of removing the whole belt, I can just pop the buckle off and back on again.    If the buckle included a method to lock the the piece that holds it to the belt down once it was on there, this thing would be perfect.  I hope the company reads these reviews, I think this is a winner of an idea.    EDITED 9\/3\/14. See reply(s) below. Excellent customer service merited an addition of a star to my original review."}

The matching bottoms in small are the perfect length, not too tight across the butt, they COVER my butt when I bend down & I like the slits at the bottom of the leg so they flare slightly without bunching at your shoes. I really liked the look of the snaps at the waist of this top & will buy more. Fashionable & professional. Love them!"}

Thank god I listened to the reviews telling me to get a 34B instead of my usual 32B because the 34 actually fits perfectly! It's beautiful, but does have some manufacturing flaws such as pieces of flyaway strings, but they can easily be trimmed. I haven't washed this bra yet, so I'm not sure how well it holds up after being washed, but basically it's a $9 bra, so don't expect the world from it, but it is beautiful and definitely does it's job! Seriously even if this bra fell apart I would still buy a new one because it's so cheap and gorgeous and it makes my boobs look fantastic. I highly recommend this bra! And did I mention it comes with extra padding that you can add in? That's pretty awesome too! Like I said before though, MAKE SURE YOU BUY ONE BAND LENGTH UP! You're probably okay on your cup size, but you are definitely going to need one band length size. This bra is easily the best $9 I've ever spent!"}

{"label":2,"review":"As others have mentioned, the seams are a strange design - no seams on the sides, and in the back there are two seams running vertically about 8 inches apart  (it almost looks like a diaper in this regard). I'm not sure why they make it this way, but the end result is that it doesn't fit great. While wearing, it puffs out from the waistband a bit. When wearing pants this extra material on the side isn't that noticeable, although they do tend to ride up as the day goes on. Overall it feels like they are too wide and not long enough. If these were longer I would have chalked it up to the sizing running slightly differently and needing to get a size lower. But these are already a tad short, so there isn't much point to risk it and have the smaller size be completely too small.<br \/><br \/>Material-wise these boxers are also mediocre. Out of the box they are practically cardboard, but after washing they are wearable. They are the thin, sturdy kind of material - more like bed sheets than a t-shirt. A little scratchy, but not that much worse than other pairs I have made of that style of fabric.<br \/><br \/>Certainly not my favorite, and I'd never buy them again. But I do wear them when I go through my favorite pairs before I do laundry. If I could give them a 2.5 I would, but they aren't good enough for a 3"}

My only complaint is that the lettering could be more legible if better planned out.    Regardless, this shirt still gets a lot of respect among the geeks who are in the know."}
{"label":4,"review":"It fit as expected...very comfortable."}
{"label":5,"review":"I am very pleased with this wallet.  very organized with many places to put cards, etc, This is the 4th item I have purchased in eelskin from this vendor and they are all excellent quality.  Fast shipping also."}
{"label":5,"review":"Purchased it for some casual use, but was wearing it in studio and some important meetings. Loved them till the end."}
{"label":2,"review":"A bit large"}
{"label":5,"review":"This vest fits nicely, is well made and is very soft.  It has all the pockets a vest can have.  For the price this is a really good buy."}
{"label":5,"review":"very warm, i would recommend."}
{"label":4,"review":"Haven't worn it yet but its not bad at all"}
{"label":4,"review":"Beautiful... it looks like the picture and has no glaring flaws in design or construction. A really nice wardrobe addition; not too dandy."}
{"label":3,"review":"Ran small"}
{"label":5,"review":"This wig has the perfect amount of hair.  It doesn't look too cheap, it isn't thin or scraggly, and the fact that it's mostly one length will make it awesome for styling it the way I want to!  Thank you!"}
{"label":5,"review":"This is a great thing!  It's very warm, the flip-back-able hands and feet are a great thing, and although it's large on a newborn it still fits my 7-month-old (and he's 52nd percentile so just about average)."}
{"label":4,"review":"It works"}
{"label":2,"review":"Product is just OK. But... don't buy if:<br \/>1. Avoid if you wear reading glasses (i.e. if you are near sighted), as it is too close to your eyes.<br \/>2.  Since it's too close to your eyes, night time driving with it distracts.<br \/><br \/>I finally purchased one that uses the CD slot to mount is the best. Donated this one for free at craigslist."}
{"label":4,"review":"They look good, but the sequins on the pair I recieved are more of a matte than a shiny sequin. Kinda bummed by that, but still a good looking pair of pants for a special occasion."}
{"label":5,"review":"I absolutely love this bra it fits great and looks gorgeous would definitely buy again"}
{"label":4,"review":"I was skeptical of these when I got them.<br \/>I thought they were going to be too tight, and chafe my inner leg.<br \/>They were snug but not uncomfortable.<br \/>I will definitely keep ordering these."}
{"label":5,"review":"My boyfriend really wanted this items and we were both really happy with it, they look really nice. Thank you"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great Item, Great Seller,Works Great"}
{"label":5,"review":"Fast delivery and perfect fit."}
{"label":4,"review":"!<br \/>This is a Christmas gift so I don't know how they fit yet, but they look large"}
{"label":3,"review":"Somehow I expected better material quality, but I assume this is what one gets for this price. Would I buy another one or recommend this Jacket..... no."}
{"label":5,"review":"Read other reviews and decided to try them.  Wow, are they comfortable and cool, fitting and supporting like a fine glove!<br \/>Beats out wet cotton briefs by a good margin.  I'll be getting more."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very simple, but great costume. Instantly recognizable and very popular. My only complaint is the shirt doesn't come in more sizes, as the SM\/MD was just a bit too small for me."}
{"label":1,"review":"It was soft, the only issue was that it didn't stay on to well and the didn't really keep everything in place. I would say that they are a little unpractical."}
{"label":5,"review":"Nice pants and comfortable to wear. Appreciate the Nautica Product and the delivery service, timely and in perfect condition!  FTD"}
{"label":5,"review":"Very warm, snug around the middle (or perhaps my middle is too large), but length and shoulders fit fine.  Zippered legs make for easy on\/off.  Very durable fabric.  Knit cuffs in sleeves keep drafts and snow out"}
{"label":5,"review":"great quality for the price"}
{"label":3,"review":"True to fite on size chart.  Buckle too heavy so the belt doesn't stay in place.  Top is slightly different in style.  The top sleeveless area is more squared off then curved and burgandy tie ribbon does not go all the way up to the bust area.  Overall still worth the price."}
{"label":4,"review":"These masks are great. Def not cheap. I would suggest re-enforcing the velcro on the side.;..it does tend to slip by the end of the night of wearing the mask. But as far as the mask quality, its much nicer than what you get at an art store."}
{"label":3,"review":"These socks are soft and I was hoping I'd found socks I could order over and over, but already (!) one has sprung a hole in the heel.  So... still looking for the perfect sock. :("}
{"label":2,"review":"What happened to an 8 in the US?  I am swimming in these jeans, but I have to admit the stretch jean and the dark color are great, wish there was a better design on back pocket, kind of dull...."}
{"label":3,"review":"They are not a full cut as my L.L.Bean flannel lined jeans."}
{"label":5,"review":"These headbands turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. The colors are vibrant. They wash up very nicely. They are wider than I thought they would be but that actually is perfect because you can scrunch them up to be more narrow or wear them wide. So glad I ordered them and will be ordering more in additional colors."}
{"label":5,"review":"Suuuuper love it, recommended"}
{"label":1,"review":"wrong color"}
{"label":5,"review":"I ordered this outfit for my baby boy (due here in a couple weeks), and I am very pleased with the quality.  Soft, bright colors, looks like it will hold up great in the wash.  I ordered a size 3mos and it is only a tad bigger than my Carters newborn size sleepers are.  I went ahead and ordered more of this brand!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Perfect!!!<br \/>It's gorgeous!!!<br \/>The fabric is very soft and the size is perfect.<br \/>I bought a Small, is not very tight but not very loose...<br \/>I really love this dress!!!!!!<br \/>I'll buy another one!!!!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Fit...check<br \/>Quality of fabric...check<br \/>Height of waist band...check<br \/>Shape and length...check<br \/>On all counts all I hoped it would be...high recommend!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Good product..."}
{"label":5,"review":"I ordered 3 of these hats, and this one is the only one that fit right (the others were too small, and the pom-poms not as pictured, with strings very short compared to picture)."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good for the price, waist band a little coarse"}
{"label":5,"review":"The shirt fit as expectedc and color is as pictured.  The shirt is well made and has minimal wrinkling after washing."}
{"label":4,"review":"the initial weave is a little coarse.  I expect they will soften with washing<br \/>I'll have to wait to see how firm the black is"}
{"label":1,"review":"I will be returning this item. For some reason I was under the impression that there would be multiple shirts included with the order. $6 for one plain white t-shirt is too much!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Will this item be coming back?!?!? I really want to buy this!"}
{"label":1,"review":"The plastic hook part on these broke after only a few times of wear.  Try to find some that hook on to your bra with metal, not plastic."}
{"label":5,"review":"This is a cute hate! It is more &#34;slightly loose&#34; than &#34;slouchy&#34; on my big noggin (23&#34;) but it is still warm, comfortable and stylish. It is a very solid black."}
{"label":5,"review":"I absolutely love this!! I have been looking for something that I can wear under maxi skirts and dresses and this is exactly what I want! It's really light weight and comfortable, all other types of &#34;compression&#34; are WAY too tight and cuts circulation off and they get soooo hot! This is great because it simply smooths everything out without causing the extra pudge and I'm not sweating under all the layers! As far as size goes I'm generally a 14\/16 and I orders an XL just to be safe but in the future I will get a L just to get a little more smoothness, and the material is very stretchy."}
{"label":5,"review":"So comfortable. Very flattering. Looks dressier than they feel."}
{"label":5,"review":"My husband saw an authentic kimono on one of our recent vacations, and wanted me to get one but I thought it was too expensive.  Once we got home, I went online to see if I could find something similar in my price range to surprise him. I chose this one (in red) and when it came, I was so surprised at the quality of the fabric and the detail in the kimono. It fits me fine (and I'm a size 12) so obviously it is a 'one size fits most' which is great for me since I'm curvy.  The inside of the kimono is just as beautiful as the outside, it's gorgeous!  I'm going to be getting a few more.  Love it!  Shipping was fast and it's a steal."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good fit and quality"}
{"label":5,"review":"I am a big Wilt fan.  This is my first cardie.  It is perfect and will be my go to cardie to wear with anything."}
{"label":5,"review":"Its was great! My son loved it."}
{"label":1,"review":"Size is way out of line.  I ordered size 38 and they were more like 34."}
{"label":5,"review":"Good pant."}
{"label":5,"review":"Very satisfied and good price and speedy delivery."}
{"label":4,"review":"I do not use the face covering part of the suit, because it is a bit difficult to see out of. All in all, product fits great."}
{"label":5,"review":"This wallet is awesome. I've never ordered a wallet from amazon before but, this wallet far exceeded it's expectations it's not too big not too small. Smells great fits all my cards great!!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Just bought this dress in black and pink. Fits almost like a glove. I just wish they had an extra small option. (I'm 5'4 and about 115-120lbs) The top part is a little big on me (I'm a 32 C). It's not very noticeable to others but I know when I wear it, I'll be pulling it up most of the night. There's barely any support for your boobs, so I suggest wearing some type of strapless and backless bra. The bottom part fits great and the back is very sexy."}
{"label":5,"review":"Just got these for a trip to florida next week.  they are nicely constructed and were just as expected... nice"}
{"label":5,"review":"Cool looking. Very thin, but the colors are vibrant."}
{"label":5,"review":"Perfect size."}
{"label":2,"review":"At size 48 waist these shorts fit way too long, about 4-5 inches too long."}
{"label":4,"review":"I read the reviews before hand so I ordered a size down from the measurements. It fit perfect! This suit is so flattering! If you are smaller than a C\/B cup though you may have difficulty with the top. This is probably the best cut suit I have ever had. I will definitely go for other colors and patterns in the future since I feel so good in this one."}
{"label":4,"review":"excellent for cold days. super soft."}
{"label":3,"review":"The hooks come loose.  I recommend ordering a size up from what you think you need based on the measurements provided.  You can always hook it to the tight setting."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this dress! It is rayon so it stretches but is not clingy. I am 5'6&#34; 140lbs and it fit perfectly with flats on"}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice looking wallet that is serving its purpose very well. I wanted a slim front pocket wallet, that is what I received."}
{"label":5,"review":"Beautiful camisole."}
{"label":4,"review":"It is great but the bra area is a bit smallish.  The bottom would have been too big if I had chosen the larger size.  Probably more a problem with my body than the top.  :)"}
{"label":4,"review":"light soft layer is perfect cover in summer.  Substantial collar\/ruffle for more or less coverage"}
{"label":2,"review":"I ordered a large and even my girlfriend who is several sizes smaller than me found this uncomfortable to wear.  The waist is a thick elastic band that isn't very comfortable."}
{"label":4,"review":"Kinda see through...be sure to wear black drawers! Also, the side zipper is SOOOOOOO HARD to zip! Ugggggh"}
{"label":5,"review":"Bought these for my husband, who works outdoors. According to him, they are really easy to put on\/off, keep him very warm, and not to cumbersome to work in. They're expensive, but well worth the expense. Will eventually buy another pair."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very nice under belt, Especially for the price!  Has held up very well, and can hardly tell its even there!  Would recommend it to others"}
{"label":2,"review":"The color was awesome..but it is a slimmer fit..which my hubby is NOT.. had to send it back :("}
{"label":5,"review":"The quality of this product is very good, style is also good, the price is very cheap. I like it very much, and will buy the next time."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great Belt Especially When You Travel and Expect to Put on A Few"}
{"label":1,"review":"I Didn't realize at first they were made in China because I just trusted the authenticity, however after they split up the front near the crotch I checked the tag."}
{"label":5,"review":"I've only used it once. It's kinda of bulky. But it has a full size spoon and fork. Folds out easy and is easy to clean."}
{"label":5,"review":"Only hat my son will leave on.  Very warm and cute.  Magnet is very convenient"}
{"label":2,"review":"Unfortunatelly the inner lining irritated my wife's face. Seamed to be harsh feeling. She was disappointed because otherwise she loved it!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Great Costume! The shoes covers were weird though...."}
{"label":1,"review":"These were a waste of money. I am not sure who the manufacturer is, but they apparently never tried putting these on a human."}
{"label":5,"review":"Wow, awesome shirt. I recommend highly..."}
{"label":5,"review":"Our little 2 1\/2 year old granddaughter is very petite and so the fit is perfect for her. That being said an average or large size 2 year old might find it too small. She loves it so much that she puts it on along with changing with the other 2 outfits I got her every day. I purchase these clothes for her to wear to pre-school for her first time. She is so excited and can't wait to show them to her teacher and new friends!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Gran Backpack!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Ordered these for my daughter and her friends. She loves the movie &#34;Frozen&#34;, and this was a fun item to share"}
{"label":5,"review":"Glamorise is the only bra I buy now!  The fit is and quality are very reliable (whether sport bra or non-sport bra)."}
{"label":5,"review":"for any Beer drinker and Deer hunter in your life, its a great shirt. Mine loved it."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought these for a cosplay and they work really well. The material used on the palms and fingers makes holding things actually possible, so you're not stuck slipping and sliding to pull your cellphone out or something like that while you wear 'em. Overall, a good buy! The size was spot-on, too."}
{"label":2,"review":"While these leggings seem to be of acceptable quality, they are not red as advertised and pictured. They are more of a bright pink. I needed red and was very dissapointed to open the package and find pink tights. Buyer beware..."}
{"label":3,"review":"It would be ok but I ordered the xxl and it fit more like an m."}
{"label":2,"review":"Not even close to kids size. This thing is a snug fit on an adult males head."}
{"label":3,"review":"again too small for a xl"}
{"label":5,"review":"Bought these for 2 of our teenage, ranch working sons. Worth every penny. If you want good old fashioned worth something kind of pants...these are it!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this hoodie!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I am so glad that I purchased these tights.  My child is thick and I have had a hard time finding the right size for her because she is in the in between sizes of child to a small adult.  The tights were a perfect fit and she is able to pull them above her thighs.  Everywhere else was too expensive for her age.  I will be purchasing this item again and again."}
{"label":3,"review":"Wore it to the Kentucky Derby.  Hit the trifecta and exacta.  You'd think it would be a lucky hat of sorts, but it got crushed on the way back from the Derby and is now very wrinkled."}
{"label":5,"review":"I've been experimenting lately with a few different brands and styles, but these trunks are my favorite.  I have a 33&#34; waist and the key here is the way the seat fits.  They don't ride up and the green bands keep them in place.  Time to buy more."}
{"label":2,"review":"too tight. The sizes used are incompatible to US regular sizes and should be corrected to avoid deceiving US customers"}
{"label":3,"review":"Nice shirt but sizes run small"}
{"label":5,"review":"So adorable!!! Must buy"}
{"label":5,"review":"As usual with these caps the size is as advertised. It fits very comfortable. I sometimes forget I have it on!"}
{"label":1,"review":"Too big"}
{"label":5,"review":"It was a gift for my sister in-law and she loved"}
{"label":5,"review":"Better quality than expected. Fit great.<br \/><br \/>If this helps, I normally wear a 33W x 32L, but had to order a size up with XL (34). I'm 5'11ish and around 165-170 lbs and size 34 fit me perfectly.<br \/>It is a bit longer in the length, but it is fine."}
{"label":3,"review":"I purchased this hat for my woman and it was so small that we gave it away to a toddler to wear.  This hat is made for a peanut-headed adult only.  Nevertheless, the quality of the cap is impeccable!!  That's why I gave it (3) stars."}
{"label":1,"review":"Odd fit, definitely not true to size. Thinking it is a defective dress. By the time I got back from vacation it stated I could not return it. So I am stuck with this ill fitting weird dress."}
{"label":5,"review":"Absolutely love it! Fits me perfect... Good thing I went for the Large and not Medium. Got the gold and red wristbands too, soo cool!<br \/><br \/>Only downside was that it was a lil late on delivery.. No Biggie though :D"}
{"label":5,"review":"Cutter and Buck products are well made, durable and stylish. I particularly like the longer length. The sizes run small. I usually wear a 2X, but with many Cutter and Buck products, I need one size larger."}
{"label":3,"review":"I thought the sleeves would be more open at the cuff area, but it is a pretty color and fits nicely,not too low cut."}
{"label":3,"review":"A semi sheer shrug but I felt I paid too much for it's worth. Coral is more like a tomato red."}
{"label":4,"review":"These are nice and rugged and they seem like they will last quite a long time.  The only thing I found disappointing is that they are a little snug compared to other carpenter pants on the market and the waistline is a bit high."}
{"label":1,"review":"I did not put these on when received as I was doing some traveling and not using my treadmill at home.<br \/>When I did put these on they were not a comfortable fit. They do not seem to be cut correctly. I am wondering if they are factory seconds. I will not purchase clothes again on line. You can not try them on. I should note that all my clothes are medium and these were medium. Maybe they run small. But that was not noted in the description."}
{"label":1,"review":"I normally wear med, but I ordered a large to ensure they would be comfy. Omg. Can't even get them on. Idk who these are made for. They are WAY too small. Sad. Looks like nice material."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very tight.  I usually order size L but ended up having to order a XL which still fit a little small."}
{"label":1,"review":"The vendor that Amazon used sent the hat with the words DODGERS on the back of the hat instead of the word BROOKLYN. When I called the vendor I was told that they don't carry that hat and would have to change their Ads. Well its been 3 months and they still haven't resolved my account or changed their Ads."}
{"label":2,"review":"These lasted 2.5 months for my 3yr old. They were a big hit, but I will not order from this company again since the sides ripped out from normal use in such a short amount of time."}
{"label":5,"review":"i love this!!!!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I ordered a med 5'6 145 lbs.med fit perfect . Just the right amount of spandex to hold the girls in place without a bra or to wear under Los cut sweater with bra. Super soft to sleep in . Happy with purchase."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love the embroidering on the dress.  Washed it on delicate in washer and hung to dry.. came out great.  I'm not big on hand washing"}
{"label":2,"review":"Returned - runs small."}
{"label":5,"review":"The mask got here 19 days earlier than expected and is a very good quality mask. The mask is made of a hardened material, but isn't plastic (as stated above) and the white of the mask is ever so slightly darker than in the photo, the mask is very comfortable to wear and is easy to see out of.  There are no air holes in the nose, but that doesn't take away from breath ability, you can talk with it sliding and it doesn't slide. The elastic that secures the head pad (which feels like leather on the out side and has a carpet like texture on the inside) stretches and feels secure, it is adjustable and out of the package fit my head perfectly (I have a big head). I'm very happy with this purchase and can't wait to get the other three masks to have the whole crew."}
{"label":5,"review":"All i can say is that it is pretty and i really like it."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this scoop neck  top and have ordered 6 of them. They run a bit small but are excellent in quality and appearance. Would recommend for sure."}

{"label":5,"review":"I love these pjs.  They are so soft and comfortable.  I feel so pretty going to bed. So should get them too."}
{"label":4,"review":"Pretty shirt the arms are attached to sides. Just has area for belt go through."}
{"label":4,"review":"Picked this up as a prop for a play and it looked pretty good on stage. The FBI letters on my badge were not painted black but this was used for a stage play so I just painted the letters myself. This wouldn't look too good for a movie or photoshoot but did the trick!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I strongly disagree with the negative reviewers. This is super soft cotton, perfect for sleeping in or wearing on a hot day. Just because it doesn't come from Duck Commander doesn't make it \\\\\"not the real thing\\\\\", in my opinion. It says \\\\\"hap-pay\\\\\" because that's how Phil says it sometimes. It's cute! I love the purple, my friends are jealous, and I'm getting another one."}
{"label":5,"review":"This is my favorite new shirt.It runs a little big,but not enough to order another size.The shirt is soft and comfy and I wear it a lot."}
{"label":3,"review":"I'm not sure if it's that my incision is too long, but the gel incision care does not cover the incision totally so the pant is biting into the rest of the incision and is very uncomfortable."}
{"label":5,"review":"Man this dang ol shirt fit real nice man, tell you what, nice color too man."}
{"label":1,"review":"Fit us akward. It's a but large at the too of the cup, the craftsmanship is extremely poor, as the sides poke at you as if it was underwire. I guess you do get what you pay for. If this was returnable it would be going back without a doubt! Cannot recommend."}
{"label":5,"review":"Perfect!"}
{"label":1,"review":"Run 3 sizes at least too small!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this blouse.  It goes well with anything.  Whether semi-formal, elegantly casual or casual.<br \/>The colours are cool and it is easy to maintain. A real wash and ready to wear piece."}
{"label":5,"review":"If you love Perry this shirt is for you. It is high quality cotton, shows Perry's face and will get people's attention for sure!"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a great confortable dress with a sporty, casual but very feminine look.  I am 5'7\\\\\" and a size 4 in jeans and I bought the medium.  It's very comfortable with a little wiggle room, I think for the more fitted look like the model i would have purchased the small.  I bought the pink which is very thin, and rather see through, i think a darker color would be more recommended for outer wear.  But overall great style, great look, great price and very comfrotable!  i am very pleased :)"}
{"label":4,"review":"So I bought this for my 2yo and she loves them. They do not feel like the most durable necklace and bracelet but my little girl is way more gentle than my 2 boys were. Fun set for a little girl who loves Minnie."}
{"label":5,"review":"My husband. Works in these jeans on a daily basis.  He finds them to be comfortable and sturdy for all the things he does around the farm. He will continue to order more as needed if no major changes are made to the fit."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good quality fast delivery but too small. I buy the xxl that it say that is the equivalent to US large but it was too small"}
{"label":3,"review":"Rather tight. Get a size higher than usual."}
{"label":4,"review":"Fit great. Arrived Quickly. Just what I hoped for."}
{"label":4,"review":"i bought this as a birthday gift for a friend. she really loved the gift and is wearing it all the time. The only complain she has is that the color of the chain does not match the color of the egg. She wants to buy a new chain that looks as antique as the egg."}
{"label":4,"review":"The lining is not wool, it's acrylic. But it is a well made and beautiful coat."}
{"label":5,"review":"Love it!!! Soft and made ok. Something that won't last as the stitching is not the best, but I like it a lot"}
{"label":2,"review":"This swimsuit fit my daughter in the length, but it was entirely too wide in the shoulders.  The straps did not stay on her shoulders.  I returned it."}
{"label":5,"review":"The is about the 20th BH Bass Shirt I have from Amazon and I have been happy with every one. They always fit just the way I like."}
{"label":1,"review":"shirt hangs nothing like it does on model, I had been so excited to get this shirt and had plans on wearing it on our vacation. Instead this shirt is now hung in the back of my closet and will probably end up thrown away."}
{"label":5,"review":"loved it."}
{"label":1,"review":"Had upside down crosses on it soooo different then believeing in Jesus"}
{"label":3,"review":"It's okay. I got the monkey one. The color of the monkey's face isn't the same as the color of the stomach, so I don't like to put the hood up. The buttons going down the middle also come off, so I really wish it was a zipper. I'm 5'3 and it runs a little small, I wish I got a bigger size. I like wearing it because it's just a fun thing to wear, but I wouldn't really recommend it."}
{"label":5,"review":"Loved it...perfect hat for the price....will probably buy more!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Fit is a little big for compression shorts. Otherwise seem to be good quality and I'll probably order a smaller size."}

{"label":2,"review":"Too short in bottoms of legs, too large up top. Doesn't fit quite right, something is off. I wouldn't recommend this product and wouldn't buy again."}

{"label":5,"review":"I very much enjoyed my purchase experience with this seller. I needed to change delivery date and received quick, helpful response, and got the package extra quick. The petticoat is great, beautiful material, holds the skirt nicely and it is very comfortable at waist. Unfortunately I ordered the shorter version, but that is my fault, the product itself is wonderful and it cam very quickly!"}
{"label":1,"review":"When I recieved the product they were not thigh high, they are full stockings. Not as advertised! I returned them."}
{"label":5,"review":"Fast shipping Great product"}
{"label":2,"review":"I don't even know where to begin with this. It's basically a few pieces of material. I could have gone to the fabric store and made this. It would be too much hassle to return which is the only reason I'm keeping it."}
{"label":4,"review":"It will contour to your face and it is very pretty, especially with some dark cat-eye makeup.  With the ties on the mask you will need to make sure it is secured,m with bobby pins or a certain hairstyle.  If not it can obscure your vision a little."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great parka! Fit my 9yr old son more than comfortably, with enough room for a sweater, scarf & freedom of movement."}

{"label":3,"review":"It was a good bag to carry small thing and for bikes rides but it didn't last long, lasted about 4 months"}
{"label":2,"review":"Bought a size smaller and was still to large, however it was very nice fabric for a low price."}
{"label":2,"review":"It was too tight around the neck."}
{"label":1,"review":"This dress is horrible. The material weighs a ton, and the sizing is completely off. The picture looks really pretty, but the actual dress looks nothing like that. I do not recommend this dress."}
{"label":3,"review":"Well made jeans but the regulars are cut like the relaxed fit. Thus, they are way too big and have to be boiled to shrink to fit."}
{"label":5,"review":"Ever have that feeling where you put something on and it instantly becomes one with you? And the more you have it on, the more you fall in love? Well ladies and gentlemen, this is that something. I bought this jacket in the granite heather, size small. For reference, I am 5'3.5&#34;, at around 110 pounds. I absolutely LOVE this jacket. It fits me perfectly. It's not too loose, not too tight. It's a perfect length, slightly longer in back, nice when sitting down. The pockets are deep and comfortable.The sleeves aren't too long. I like the hole for the thumb, but it is long and loose enough to roll or scrunch up if needed. The color is exactly as pictured. One thing I didn't notice on the picture is the zipper and logo is slightly purple. More so in person, but not enough to clash with anything, so I'm ok with it (and believe me, I'm EXTREMELY picky when it comes to colors clashing). I cannot say enough good things about this jacket. It was over 80\u00b0 in my house, but once I tried the jacket on, I couldn't bear to take it off. Interestingly enough, I didn't get overheated despite the absurd inside temperatures. This shows me that the material is breathable and can keep me at a comfortable temperature despite my surroundings.<br \/>Usually I wait a few MONTHS before I write a review on a product to make sure my opinions are true to the quality of the product, but this jacket is receiving a review within 2 HOURS of trying it on. If my opinions about this jacket change at all, I will update my review, but I honestly don't see that ever happening. I love this jacket!! It is stylish and comfortable and I don't ever want to take it off! BUY THIS JACKET!!"}
{"label":5,"review":"There is nothing bad to say about these, finally some jeans that fit perfectly.  Aren't too &#34;skinny&#34; nor are they baggy.  Just because they say slim doesn't mean they are super tight, or skinny they fit great.<br \/><br \/>Quality is higher than most brands even including the reaction line although those are good too these are just a step up..<br \/><br \/>Just a little bit darker than pictured, but perfect if you wash them.<br \/><br \/>One last note, the bottom is not straight, nor boot, its tapered for a great look."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought this from their website (and not from amazon) and it fits well.  I'm 5'7\\\\\" and 125 lbs and the only things that is tight on it would be the sleeves.  Its color matches the picture shown with this product.  I would recommend wearing it with a tank top or cami underneath since it is a bit sheer."}

Got lots of compliments & candy ;-)  Will purchase again next year."}

Tried on a couple pair of my other pants to make sure I didn't gain a few overnight and sure enough they're a little too small. Still very good quality jeans and comfortable. Just too tight for my style. I will wait until I lose some poundage before I wear these on the regular."}

After waiting for 3 weeks with no package, I checked the tracking number provided by Menswallet--it wasn't linked to any shipped package according to USPS.  The shipper advised me to simply wait... and wait and wait.  Finally, when I filed a complaint with Amazon, Menswallet quietly refunded my money without further explanation.  So, it could have been worse, but it was a waste of time dealing with Menswallet."}

{"label":5,"review":"This housecoat makes me feel so elegant and beautiful when I wear it, like a princess or Victorian lady of the house. I have black, small. I'm a B and the bodice cut is very flattering, and fits perfectly. The design is totally enchanting, and it's my favorite purchase of last year. This is the peignoir of yesteryear. My boyfriend and I love its vintage\/gothic look. I actually wore it as an 'overdress' as part of my vampire halloween costume. I highly recommend buying it together with its matching nightgown.<br \/><br \/>I initially felt the nylon material was cheap, but after wearing, it is soft, silky, light and flowy, even if it's not satin. The lace is soft, but could be 'scratchy' to sensitive skin. It's very comfortable, and reaches to lower shin. With black, it's sometimes difficult to get all the laundry soap to wash off.<br \/><br \/>The three buttons that fasten the bodice are a bit difficult to button, and look cheap. I would expect they could wear out within a few years. To me, the bodice is pleasantly snug, but too tight to wear to bed. I love wearing it as a light but insulating layer during the winter."}

It fits like a sac with with holes no curves or shape whatsoever. And finally it looks like it cost $16 not quite the $160 I paid for it. Not worth the expense at all. Way too much too spend on a dress this poorly constructed and cheap-looking. Sending back straight away."}

{"label":4,"review":"I bought these to go with a pair of waterproof shoes for a recent trip to Colorado. They functioned very well and kept my feet warm in temperatures down to about 20 F. Even more impressive, they were perfectly fine to wear at room temperature. They were also far more comfortable then the cheap cotton socks I'm used to, and not the least bit itchy or irritating. The only drawback is the thickness of the sock - after a long walk I could feel how much more snug my shoes were around my toes."}

I would buy them again and I have purchased shirts in every color offered."}

{"label":5,"review":"This white girl has a &#34;ghetto booty&#34; and a small waist, which makes getting pants and jeans to fit properly a bit of a challenge. Enter the Invisibelt! No suffering from the dreaded &#34;gaposis&#34; when I sit down, and no bulk from either the belt or the buckle to ruin the slim lines of my outfit. I was slightly concerned that my over-dyed jeans may stain the clear belt but I have had zero issues. Easy to adjust as needed for different pants, and stays comfortably in place all day long. I could not be happier with this purchase!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I can not say how much I love this bra. I had bought a different brand in a local store after being helped by a professional fitter at almost three times the price and when I get home I can't wait to peel it off. This Warner bra - the same size, by the way, as the expensive brand - is so comfortable I can wear it all day and night without noticing it."}
{"label":5,"review":"nice and warm!"}
{"label":3,"review":"The custom looks good and the quality seems very good considering the price.  However the size is way too small.  I am only 5'9&#34; tall and weight under 150 lbs and typically have 32 or 33 inch inseam and I could barely move in it.  I am afraid if I bent over it would rip...not to mention the &#34;wedgie&#34; in the process.  Too tight in the upper body.  If I could get a larger size it would be perfect.  Unfortunately I will need to send it back.  Nothing wrong with it...just doesn't fit me."}
{"label":4,"review":"The material wasn't what I expected. It's like a thermal check with a fleece-fuzzy inside. It isn't very thick material. The material is a bit see-through so black or white underneath the red kinda shows. The red is very bright. That said, despite my hesitation I wear it a lot and get a lot of compliments. I'm 5' 7&#34; and about 130lb and the small fits well, but isn't long enough for leggings, at least not to my comfort level. Great with skinny jeans. Love the neckline. Ordering a second in another color."}

{"label":5,"review":"Bought this is petunia in small and when I first took it out of the bag, it seemed like it would be big.  Tried on the pants and they are a tad bit long, but I'm only 5'4 and usually buy pants in short.  The top fits well, and there's a built in bra (not heavy duty, but light and comfortable).  Fabric is soft and lightweight.  Very comfortable and nice color."}

I originally ordered an extra small and it was too tight across the chest, I am a size 2 in tops or an extra small but not in this style."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good looking and good quality.  Really like the Velcro at the wrists for a snug fit."}
{"label":5,"review":"Very comfortable to wear as though you not wearing them. Awesome material and so sexy too, its great that men can now wear lace, Now I can wear them to work, and any time I like wearing them and feeling good in myself, I just love them as I brought more for spares to keep in my draws so I got a back up."}
{"label":5,"review":"The fit is snug, but, I will use these with hiking boots and running shoes so a snug fit is desirable. These socks are 70% polypropylene which is an extremely tough material, so I expect these socks to last a long time."}

{"label":5,"review":"Some men may find the lack of a zipper a show stopper. This is normal for a heavy\/cold pant that some would call a Ski pant. Just an FYI.<br \/><br \/>Construction is very good, I would even say, great. I didn't even know there was a micro fiber lined pant until I arrived in Berlin 5 years ago, *totally* not packed for winter there. I ran to a district that specialized in small merchants and found this category of pant (with a zipper). They saved my rear end, and we're not too expensive.<br \/><br \/>After some years of winter use, they are ready to die, so I came looking on Amazon and found these. They cost just a bit more then my Berlin purchase and are:<br \/><br \/>Heavier. Better construction. Black only.<br \/><br \/>Being micro fiber, I can get away with two pair. One to wear, one washed and hanging dry. The only issue I see arising is some motels in the EU have smart keys which shut off the heat\/lights in the room when you are not inside. Then they may not dry hanging in the shower while you are gone for the day."}

Love the fact that the back has a velcro allowing more room the change the baby into the costume. The head piece and the wings are detachable.<br \/><br \/>Finally, the material is a little shinny and thin enough so the baby don't get hot quickly.

He has been using his old tuxedo for 3 years.  it is still good except that it is too short for him now that he really needs a new one.  Since this will be his last year in orchestra, I did not want to buy an expensive one.  My son is very slim so shirt is too big for him on the neck, he does not need the vest too which seems so short.  All he really needs would be the pants and the jacket. Even if we are not able to use the vest and shirt, am still satisfied with what I paid for.  Son wishes though that the pockets were real."}

I usually wear a small size but these are running big so I bought XSmall size that fits perfect. The pants are made a little lower than the waist and for that reason the other reviews complaint of the pants are hard to keep on. The fabric is not soft like \\\\\"buttercup\\\\\" fabric but holds well whole day working and look professional. In the wash does very well and maintains the color and does not wrinkle much. I definitely buy more in the future for the price is good and the shipping is low."}

In reality it doesn't feel like flannel, which to me evidently means 100% cotton.  This sleep shirt feels like a cross between flannel and fleece.  Not awful, just not the flannel I expected.<br \/><br \/>Also, the shirt doesn't fit very well.  With only two sizes to choose from I figured it was either 'too big' or 'too small'.  I went for 'too big' and it is indeed that.  I normally wear a L on top.  The larger of the two sizes fits me with room for another me in the armpits (only slight exaggeration)."}

So really only used the over night ones at night and didn't use the regular ones until about 4 months PP.  Well, now that my daughter is 4 months old and my supply has regulated more and I'm not having so much let down on the opposite side as the one I'm nursing on, these are perfect! They are soft and not itchy; I was having trouble with the Lansinoh disposables being itchy, and of course they wash well.

{"label":5,"review":"I have this dress in lavender and black and I adore it.  I call it the \\\\\"Dress of Requirement\\\\\"--Harry Potter fans will recognize the reference to the Room of Requirement, a room that transformed into whatever you needed it to be.    This dress is not chiffon, but a lovely lightweight rayon, soft as a summer breeze and so lightweight and breathable that you can just float through the heat looking cool as a cucumber.  It's not particularly sheer, not even in lavender, but because it's so lightweight layering up is not a problem if you think you should.  I wear it as a dress, as a swim coverup, as a nightgown, as a lounge outfit, to the beach, to church, funky with boots or casual with sandals or dressy with heels.  It is The Perfect Dress.    I am an Extra Curvy Girl of Fairly Robust Dimensions but I do have a waist, and the ruching at the waist of this dress celebrates that without clinging anywhere else. Even if you don't have a waist, you'll look like you do in this dress.  It's got that hourglass effect. The looooooong sleeve ties are a little perplexing, but who cares?  The \\\\\"deep V\\\\\" neckline is less deep that the description makes it sound, but if that's the effect you're after there are buttons that can be undone.    Get two--or three.  You'll want another one anyway and you won't have to pay the shipping twice."}

These are &#34;seethroughish&#34; and I wouldn't suggest wearing them alone as pants but I bought them to wear under skirts and for that purpose they are great! They are warm and provide just the right amount of protection from a cold Minnesota wind. I am 5'4&#34; and about 160 right now (with a little prego belly) and these seem to be the right length and have enough room on top to accommodate a larger behind and belly.However, if you are taller than 5'7&#34; I would think these would be to short. They have a wide but soft band at the top that will be perfect to pull up over my undoubtley large pregnant belly. They don't seem like they will fall down after wearing them for a while. Very soft material on the inside although I wouldn't call it fleece. Seriously the best buy for the money and believe me I've done my research looking for a good pair at a reasonable price."}

Overall, I was very pleased once I had fixed the belt issue."}
{"label":5,"review":"I have the cropped version of these jeans, same &#34;wash&#34; (fabric content, color) from Anthropologie, and wanted to get them in the longer length.  They are a nice deep black, thick (not too thick, but perhaps a bit heavy for summer) fabric weight, with the right amount of stretch.  I haven't worn this pair yet, but I do find myself &#34;hiking up&#34; the cropped jeans over the course of the day.  The 28's were a little too snug (all over), so I got the 29's (probably needed a 28 1\/2--LOL).<br \/><br \/>The jean is a nice skinny jean, without being ultra skinny (bottom leg opening is wide enough to get the jeans on and off!).<br \/><br \/>I have washed the cropped pair once, and do notice a slight loss of color compared to this new pair (unwashed).<br \/><br \/>*One important thing to note; fabric content seems to make a big difference in how these jeans fit.  Not only with regards to size (I needed a 29 in these, and a 28 in another Lily Skinny Straight Jean from Anthro), but also in how well or how nicely they fit.  The &#34;twill&#34; (?) denim (fabric content) just didn't fit the same, or look as nice on me as the Watson wash pairs or the other pair from Anthro."}

{"label":3,"review":"The Cardigan itself is great. The materials are nice looking and quality is high, in spite of having a fairly decent price. Shipping was remarkably fast, although it arrived in nothing but a transparent plastic bag with no indications from the brand.<br \/><br \/>Now, you really have to make a throughout research on the right size to order because it\u2019s hard to figure out. TheLees uses Chinese clothing standards you probably need to convert to US standards, which can be twice as big or small and can lead to confusions. And if you don\u2019t regularly use US standards (because, like me, you don\u2019t live in the US) you\u2019ll need to figure out more specific conversions using the metric system. The sizing info you get here in the Amazon website is very broad and vague, so I went over to TheLees website to get their specific sizing. Turns out their website has very good information on this matter and you\u2019ll probably be better off if you check it out first before buying based solely on the Amazon sizing info.<br \/><br \/>Finally, if you\u2019re interested in buying from TheLees is likely you\u2019re looking for slim clothing. Bear in mind pictures in websites are never as accurate as the real version, and while this brand specializes in slim clothing and the Cardigan is indeed slim fitted, you will notice it doesn't look as great as it does in the pictures \u2013 probably because the average buyer isn\u2019t a muscular male model, like the dummy shown."}

{"label":5,"review":"I received this as a review sample and it compares favorably to a plethora of other hand graters that I own. It's fairly large with a grating surface that measures 7 3\/8 inches long and a full inch wide. The overall length of the blade is a little over 8 inches long, but my first measurement is for the actual grating blades.<br \/><br \/>My first test was on a piece of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and it grated it without crumbling. I keep that particular cheese at room temperature wrapped in tin foil and other graters will either crumble it or their blades quickly clog. This one can literally go for five plus minutes of continuous grating (of the hard cheese). I performed a quick test grating of luya (ginger root) and a piece of chocolate and the results were different. The ginger required that I frequently wipe the blades to clear them, and the chocolate need to be cold in order to grate properly. The key to that is to grate it in small chunks, around 1x3 inches and ensure that the chunks waiting to be grated are in the refrigerator until you are ready for the next piece.<br \/><br \/>This will work as a zester, even on limes, but you need to develop a touch for it because the grating blades will easily wear down the skin. I am very pleased with this in that role because I do a lot of Mediterranean cooking that uses lemon zest.<br \/><br \/>Other things I love are the large diameter handle that is also semi soft. It makes grating large projects a lot less labor intensive. Also, the blade comes with a plastic guard that will protect it against dulling as well as inflicting injuries on you if you are groping around in a utensil drawer."}
{"label":3,"review":"I would have given this item 2.5 stars were that possible, but it wasn't quite as bad as a \\\\\"2,\\\\\" so....<br \/><br \/>Let me talk first about SIZE for this item:  Generally, if the item in question is a sweater or some other type of material that might have some give or stretch, I order a MEDIUM.  If, however, it's another type of material, I order a LARGE because I'm very broad in the shoulders and bust area.  When this arrived, I didn't even need to try it on -- I could just look at it and tell that it wouldn't fit.  Hope springs eternal, though, so I tried to get it on, anyway; I got one arm in, and it wasn't even wide enough for me to attempt getting my other arm in (it probably would have ripped right down the back because the material is VERY thin).  Just out of curiosity, I grabbed my 11-year-old daughter, who's a little over 5-feet tall and weighs just under 110 pounds and had her try it on...luckily, it fits her perfectly (and SHE really likes it), so it wasn't a total waste of money.  Just beware that there isn't any sizing information for this particular item (just the generic sizing info offered by Amazon), and I can kind of see why -- if a LARGE fits a 110 pound tween perfectly, then they're cut VERY, VERY small...so small, in fact, that they should probably be classified as a \\\\\"junior\\\\\" item.  And for the record, my daughter wears a GIRL'S (not junior's) size 14\/16, but more for the length than the size since she's so tall for her age.<br \/><br \/>Also, there wasn't a picture of the BLACK cardigan, only the WINE colored one, and I can tell you right now, that the black one doesn't look like the wine-colored one; the closest similarity is in the way the pockets hang.  In the picture, it looks as though there are quite a few ruffles along the lapel line in the way it lays, but (at least the black one) doesn't look like that in reality.  Perhaps some creative ironing might remedy that and make it look, \\\\\"fancier\\\\\" like the one in the picture, but I have my doubts.And I hate ironing.  And I don't even know if 100% Rayon irons well, anyway.  My daughter had no expectations, though, since she had no prior idea of what it was supposed to look like in the first place; if she were writing this review, she'd probably rate it higher.<br \/><br \/>The last and most important thing I want to say here is to reiterate what I wrote about sizing; please beware the sizing before buying."}

In general I really expected more from the Hanes brand. I was surprised how cheap the material feels, it's thick but not soft in the slightest. The truly  aggravating par twas the size variance in that one single pack ran rampant, the first pair I unrolled fit okay at the waist but I easily had 2 inches of flappy extra material on either side of my thighs,  I unrolled a second pair, these fit well but were a bit snug at the thighs, at that point I unrolled each pair and tried them on. out of the 6 pack, 2 were a bit snug, 1 pair was huge and 3 fit pretty much as they should. I laid one of each &#34;fit&#34; on my bed on top of each other just to see the difference. Between the too snug and the ones that fit well there was about a 1&#34; difference and the difference between the ones that fit well and the ones that were too big there was about a 1 1\/2&#34; difference at the waist but became about a 3 or so inch difference as you moved further down the boyshorts. Won't ever purchase this cut again, and with such a bad first impression I don't know if i'll purchase any type hanes underwear again."}

It fits perfectly, not too tight, but snug enough that I don't have to worry about the Hawaiian trade winds blowing it off my head.  The quality is about 3 times better than I expected... I wear fitted hats backwards sometimes, and this hat delivers on that sleek sporty look frontward OR backward.  I still can't get over the quality and feel of this hat.<br \/><br \/>One thing to note... these are MESH hats, so besides the front panel, the other 4 panels are somewhat see through... In a dark color, it's not even noticeable, but if you're like me and wear it backward, be warned that your forehead would show through on a lighter color (I have a white Oakley hat like this one that I can't wear backward because it just looks ridiculous seeing my forehead through it.

{"label":5,"review":"I have the men's equivalent and these are the best smart gloves I've seen or owned.  For anyone saying they can't use the smart tips on their phone either: 1) have the wrong size gloves or 2) need to wear them in a little bit.<br \/><br \/>Once you break them in they are much easier to use, less stiff, and work much better.<br \/><br \/>As others have stated they are decently warm, but the tips are mesh so they do let in a little more cold than a full non smart pair would, but that should be obvious.  These are great for wearing and using with your phone in inclimate weather."}
{"label":3,"review":"Looked like a nice coat but ran way too small. I am an XL and could not zip it. Gave to my mom who is a small to medium and it was too small for her.  End up giving it to a friend who is a small frame. I wish it would have fit, I would have liked the coat. Did they put wrong size tag in?"}
{"label":4,"review":"I got these for a wedding hoping they would pull everything in and they were sort of on the looser side.  They were really comfortable and high quality, I m sure ill wear the, many times, but they aren't tight at all.  Maybe sizing one size down would help."}
{"label":5,"review":"Really love these pants, comfortable fit, and nice and stretchy"}
{"label":5,"review":"Excellent product!  The fit is perfect (I have a normal build, not a &#34;super-size those fries, I'll just get a bigger chair!&#34;).<br \/>The fabric is great, the colors are perfect (no white, pink, nor red), and the construction is perfect.<br \/><br \/>I ordered two sets in order to get free shipping - great idea, it turns out.  Even the little label in front is a plus in the morning."}
{"label":5,"review":"I absolutely love these shirts, bought two for $11 apiece and that was an outrageous deal in my opinion. The fit is great, its not too tight and not billowy, and works ridiculously well as a base layer. Even by itself, I remain comfortable in 45-50 degree weather, but that might just be me. Great for hiking or just staying warm, truly a quality product."}
{"label":5,"review":"Fits great, quality seems fine (of course I havent washed it 100 time yet so we'll see). Fabric feels very heavy, which may be a blessing in the long term but makes it a hot wear in the summer heat."}
{"label":5,"review":"These merino wool socks are a killer deal.  They fit and feel terrific and they are a great price.  I also picked up some of their boxers and feel great wearing Woolly!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I am a pear shape 5'4&#34; with  a little more weight than I want and they fit  and look great!  The waist is high enough so muffin top is not an issue.  They are cut close around the knee which I like better than the regular bootcut. The length is perfect for a shoe with a little bit of a heal and of course boots."}
{"label":5,"review":"Love the design and fit."}
{"label":5,"review":"Got this for my father, an ardent meditator.  He immediately wrapped up and got down to business.  He loves it, says its very warm and beautiful too.  It arrived right on time!"}
{"label":2,"review":"too large"}
{"label":2,"review":"Too small.... cute though. Gave to my sister who is a size medium and I ordered the largest size possible!"}
{"label":5,"review":"This is one of the most comfortable dresses I have to wear around the house. I am barely 5'2 and normally wear a Large to Extra Large. After reading the reviews I decided to order a size larger to the 18-20 and it fits perfectly with the hem hitting just above my knees. Tight enough to get my Husbands attention but loose enough to be totally comfortable after a day in business clothes. The fabric is a bit thin but its summer time and perfect for the warmer season. I have ordered another design and cant wait to get it."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great, comfortable fit!"}
{"label":1,"review":"Very very very small."}
{"label":5,"review":"This was a 2014 xmas gift for my fiance.  He loves it and I'm buying one for myself. Ture to size."}
{"label":5,"review":"These cargo shorts are well crafted and the fit is excellent; I checked them against almost identical Levi cargo shorts on sale at Macy's; the price was better and the substitution of snaps instead of buttons for pocket enclosures was a bonus. I highly recommend them!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Perfect for my trip to Hawaii!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I ordered this shirt for my husband and he loves it.  The fit is perfect!  I ordered a Large and it fits as expected."}

{"label":5,"review":"6 MONTH UPDATE: I still love wearing this when working out especially when lifting. I have worn this many times both under and over a tank and had no preference until today. After wearing this clincher under a tank (and against my skin) for about 9 hours (not on purpose), I found 2 small blisters on my stomach. I'm guessing it's because I wore it for too long...I just thought it would be important to show what can happen if worn without anything between it and your skin...  I am 5' 3&#34; and 153 pounds. I ordered a small and it fits as expected. I do not carry much weight in my abdomen but I needed something to give my mum-tum and back some support while working out.  I absolutely love this faja. I also have the Ann Chery latex vest in a size small but am not able to work out in the vest because a) the strap width bugs me and b) because the vest is longer than this workout waist cincher which means that it is very difficult to bend in it. This workout cincher is perfect in length. I am able to do cardio and am able to lift weights without feeling like I can't breathe. I ordered the blue and it is bright and beautiful. I must say that that the only thing I do not like about this (and any) waist cincher, is that it tends to push my back fat up. That is why I originally ordered the vest. I alternate between this, the vest, and an Ann Chery classic waist cincher (also in a size small) and I can definitely see my waist becoming more defined. My back and lower abdomen also feel more relieved after any workout thanks to this cincher :) I'm thinking of trying the caffeine cream too..."}

{"label":2,"review":"Very thin, and it fit small, I even ordered a size up knowing it was for post baby.  It looks like its supposed to fit baby, but honestly it was so tight that I don't think it will be comfortable after this baby comes.  Disappointed for sure."}
{"label":5,"review":"Very nice well made sweatshirt. It was a gift for my friend and she is in love with her doberman. Her face upon opening it was enough to say that the product was a great purchase."}
{"label":5,"review":"I received this as a gift and I've been very pleased with it. It's comfortable, fits well, is made well and washes well. I think it looks really fashionable and casual.<br \/>I am 5'7'' and on the heavier side - size 14 in standard clothes. The XL works great for me."}
{"label":1,"review":"I normally wear an xs so I ordered a medium. I received it yesterday and it looks like a jacket made for a DOLL!! Too small does not even begin to describe this jacket. I am so very disappointed and will never  buy anything else! A big waste of money. :-((((((("}
{"label":5,"review":"Love!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I ordered these in 4 different colors, and they are all different - the design and the fit.  The pads are super cheap and should absolutely be removed before washing or it will look uneven like you stuffed your bra.  Some of the pads are triangles and some are circles.  The triangles look more natural and so I don't use the circle pads anymore.  I have had them for about a year now and still use them."}
{"label":3,"review":"The pajamas fit real nice and feel real nice.I am not sure how long they will last. I washed them yesterday and I noticed a little fraying in one shoulder."}

{"label":5,"review":"Well, these boxers look almost as good on my fiance as they do on the model. Guess he just needs to work on his tan a little bit now!  These are comfy, cute, soft, durable. Everything you want in a pair of men's boxers. Plus, they're name-brand if you like labels.<br \/><br \/>Only negative feature: they don't launder themselves."}

{"label":5,"review":"Very nice, good detail, fit perfectly.  I will definately stick to this brand from now on.  I purchased the bra too, and love them."}
{"label":5,"review":"Fits like a glove. Very supportive and comfortable too! You can wear it for exercising orjust everyday wear for comfort."}

Its Very snug and restrictive (cant lift my arms) and i cant really wear it. I'd like to return it but the seller has classified this as hazardous making a return darn near impossible. I have submitted a complaint in hopes that this can be resolved."}

Her mother is happy too as this is a place to keep all of her doll clothes, bottles, diapers, etc. for her daughter's doll clothes, etc.  Everything is ready to go when then leave the house since she carries her doll everywhere and the accessories are right there to go!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Nice quality and good lightning deal"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great quality, good fit.  Vendor was very accommodating when first Dirndl came with seam in the front.  This was a last minute purchase for an Oktoberfest and the vendor shipped new one right away.  I give it VERY high marks for quality (for the second one) and the vendor's response to the issue."}
{"label":5,"review":"great product soft and comfortable"}
{"label":5,"review":"Purchased this for my husband who wears an Extra Large and this is a perfect fit for him.  The material is soft and looks so nice on.  He loves it for it he stays cooler in our southern heat and humidity than in other shirts that he owns.  He said it is comfortable and feels good when he is wearing it.  Purchased this shirt to go with white and grey plaid shorts that I had recently purchased and they matched to a tee and look sharp together.  This shirt was above what I anticipated at this very reasonable price.  I highly recommend this shirt and I do not believe that you will be disappointed."}
{"label":3,"review":"I like the look and feel but a bit tight in the waist."}
{"label":3,"review":"okay...little bit tight in the knees"}
{"label":4,"review":"Perfect replica of original album from '68. Great job, brilliant colors great t-shirt."}
{"label":1,"review":"Cheap materials. Way large."}
{"label":3,"review":"I'm a gymnastics coach so crop leggings are practically what I live in. I bought these leggings  months ago and they've held up decently. I am just now seeing small holes in the knees. That could just be because my job requires me to do alot of walking and bending, etc. They are a bit tight, but they fit true to size."}
{"label":3,"review":"Its ok."}
{"label":5,"review":"These are the best socks I've ever owned!  They are warm, soft and fit well.  I don't like taking them off!  Very thick, and after four washings they hang around the calf quite well and don't slip down, so far. I like them so much that I ordered more of them so I wear a fresh pair every day for a week.  As per the vendor recommendation, since my feet sweat a lot and then get cold I purchased the J.B. Second Skin CoolMax Anti-blister Liner socks from Sox Shop as an inside liner.  I want to mention that one should purchase a bit bigger sized shoe, or if you wear two pairs of socks as I do, wear both pairs when trying on new shoes."}
{"label":5,"review":"Daughter loves wearing this. We go swimming indoors often and the pool can be quite chilly. This long sleeve rash guard helps her stay warm. My only complaint is the sleeves are quite long, but I still feel like it deserves 5 stars since the product fits elsewhere to size and does what it is intended to do. I just scrunch the sleeves up, I don't bother cuffing them. She doesn't seem to care. Overall, great product!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Just the right amount of support without feeling like a sausage. Wonderful"}
{"label":5,"review":"All very well . The sizes are as ordered. I am pleased"}
{"label":3,"review":"Not as long as it appears in the picture.  It is a razor back.  I had hoped it was regular tank sleeves."}
{"label":1,"review":"It does NOT fit like it should. I normally wear an XL and bought a 2XL and it was extremely tight. It almost felt like a large or medium. So keep that in mind when purchasing this product!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I could not love this more. I bought a medium I wear a 34dd top and a size 5 bottom it fits perfectly . I just had a baby and wanted something to cover me up a little and this is just perfect!"}
{"label":5,"review":"These socks have a wonderful texture and fit!  So soft and comfortable.  They are pricey, so I hope they hold up well after numerous washings."}
{"label":2,"review":"If you're looking for a beach cover-up, this is your thing. I was looking for a tunic for work, and while the fit is nice, it's pretty much see-through. Plus the quality isn't what is expect from Lily Pulitzer. After a normal day in the office, it had developed two two picks or pulled threads. I was hoping for a much tighter weave and less transparent top. I'm returning this one."}
{"label":4,"review":"A bit too small but our daughter is hoping to loose enough weight to wear this tunic."}
{"label":1,"review":"I ordered what was my best guess at the black one with blue spots. I chose \\\\\"Dark\\\\\". I wanted a sarong to wear with my new swim suit. When the sarong arrived, it was brown. I don't even see brown as an option. Can you tell me which one, out of the descriptions provided, all with the same picture, do you think I should have received? I am so frustrated. It's not worth returning. I paid over $5 for shipping, and they'll charge over $5 in return shipping costs. The thing only cost $10. They included a card asking me to write a good review for them. How about you change your images and\/or descriptions so your customers know what they are purchasing."}

{"label":4,"review":"Just what was ordered. lots of complements, the decal on the cape was a little worn looking but other wise great"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great and practical skinnies.  Perfect faded black.  Don't deform and stretch out as much or as quickly as some brands, I'm guessing thanks to the polyester content.  Note: fabric content incorrectly labeled by Amazon.  These are: 71% cotton, 27% poly, 2% lycra.  Lightweight and very comfortable. A bargain at this price!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I love it!! \ud83d\ude0d"}

{"label":5,"review":"I am going to rock it in my hair on my graduation day. Thanks for and cannot wait to wear it."}
{"label":5,"review":"It's a great little distressed belt snap! Looks as if from an old cowboy movie or as if it came from Wolverine himself worn for decades but it is sturdy and looks cool."}
{"label":4,"review":"I was happy to find this style (with the stretch lace at the waist) on Amazon.  I feel that the price was reasonable and the fit is comfortable for me.  I actually bought a size larger because I don't like when a panty clings to me like shown on the model.  I'll probably purchase more."}
{"label":5,"review":"E. Libby scrub pants fit well and are of good quality. They were also at a great price. I plan to buy more in the near future."}
{"label":4,"review":"I love this jacket! The material is very soft; softer than I expected. The body of the jacket was a softish cottony material, and the collar was polyester... I didn't particularly care for the polyester but over all I am very happy with the jacket. The pockets are fake (only for show) but it is well fitted and very comfortable."}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice product, scary and effective.  Not crazy about the chemically smell on the mask after arrival (makes it hard to wear for extended periods), and there is a noticeable electrical hum from the included power source.  Will likely affect the pickups on my guitar if worn on stage.  One star taken off.  Otherwise, great product."}
{"label":4,"review":"The Urban Republic Boys jackets' color combinations are fresh and uniquely homespun and stylish -- for kids. My grandsons love wearing them. Before ordering, however, it is important to note that the jacket fits one size smaller than indicated. I had originally ordered size 10-12 for an eight-year old in the red and black, then the new jacket ended up with his 6 year-year-old brother who normally wears a size 7-8! Fortunately, I was able to purchase the last available size 14-16 in black with grey and lime green --to fit the normally size 10 grandson. The picture shown for that jacket looked to be black with grey and white, but the subtle lime green piping is so much better!  Jackets are comfortable and fit closer to the body and have a sweet zippered pocket in front. Not a jacket for extremely cold mid-western weather, but just right for southern winter climates."}
{"label":5,"review":"After reading the other reviews here, I purchased it a few sizes larger than what my daughter typically wears- and it is very nice. She loved the bright orange color. The inside is lined as well."}
{"label":2,"review":"This dress didn't come in Navy blue it was black and white so it really didn't have the salior dress look"}
{"label":5,"review":"Awesome, way better than expected. Super comfy, in a bathing suit-like material, so perfect for wearing under dresses. Will buy more!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I'm really happy with the 527s as an alternative to the other 513s and 511s I have. These have maybe a slightly dressier cut to them. Snug, but not tight through the thigh and knee, then ending in a slight flared leg opening. You can't go wrong with this price either!"}
{"label":2,"review":"Clips don't hold"}
{"label":3,"review":"Quality is so-so, fabric is very gauzy and thin. This isn't a $30 sarong, so for the price I guess that's what's to be expected. However I was very surprised at the color. The picture shows a deep emerald green and lighter green, however the sarong I received was teal and dark blue\/green. Not what I expected at all, however it's still pretty. It was meant as a gift for someone who wanted green, so I hope it still pleases her."}
{"label":5,"review":"This Fleece set is even more lovely than the photo, very soft, very elegant, looks wonderful. Would highly recommend this set and it makes the perfect gift. The color is great, goes with almost anything, is suitable for everyone, from teens to grannies, and can fit anyone's style, it's really nice."}
{"label":2,"review":"I would have to order 2 separate bathing suits to be able to wear this 2 piece.  I read the reviews about the bottoms running small so I ordered a M.  The bottoms fit but I am a 34C up top and a M just does not cut it.  I wish you could choose a top and a bottom size because most people don't fit into a 1 size mold."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this dress.  I like the length because it stops at my knees.  It looks great on me."}
{"label":5,"review":"so far this is the be feeling carhartt product i own. the outer shell is a different material than normal carhartt material making it more comfortable for casual wear and inner lining is quilted."}
{"label":4,"review":"Great shirt!!  Saw it on a couple months ago on The Big Bang Theory and had to have it.  The shirt reflects the long rich history of the character (for better or worse)  Next up, the Many Cowls of Batman poster!!!"}
{"label":1,"review":"This dress is super sheer. And I mean, so sheer, you can see through it. You can't wear any sort of underwear under it without them showing, but god forbid you try to go without! It shows ALL of your goods!! So cute (style-wise), but it's useless. I can't even wear pasties or a slip under it without THOSE being too obvious. Waste of money."}
{"label":4,"review":"I would give these 5 stars except the Medium I bought was pretty tight through the shoulders, and I'm a petite gal. (5'3'', 120). I wouldn't want to go up a size because then I think the shorts and the length of the shirt would be too big, since they fit great except the shoulders. Good material, comfy otherwise and shipping was super fast."}

{"label":5,"review":"It took me a while to wear this dress as when I first put it on I thought it was a bit much for me to carry....but I recently got a new haircut and did a little twist tie in the front of the dress to make it gather more in the front for a better waist line and I got soooo many compliments.  So much so that I went back and ordered two more in different patterns."}

It has plenty of room for him to grow but the material is thin enough that he can wear it in the car seat and still be safe and warm.

{"label":5,"review":"Thank u"}
{"label":2,"review":"I read several reviews that said this product fit large so I ordered a medium and an extra small to try each (free returns and the small was out of stock).  I am 5'7, 125 pounds.  The medium fit fine, not skin tight but comfortable except for under the arms.  It really rode up in the arm pits and would have driven me crazy.  That was the reason I returned it.  The extra small fit skin tight like a rash  guard should but the armpit issue was even worse so it went back too.  The material is light weight and if you've got a bikini, or pretty much anything, under it, it will show through a lot.  I got white so that is probably part of it.  The neck of both sizes was also pretty tight and uncomfortable.  I wouldn't recommend this product.  I have Kanu rashguards for my kids though and they are just fine (at least I haven't heard the kids, 2 and 4, complain)."}

{"label":4,"review":"These undies were delivered promptly and the colors are super cute. They are very comfortable when you put them on.  My only complaint is that by the end of the day they don't retain their shape. They get kind of stretched out in the waist and legs.  Once washed they go back to fitting perfectly until you've had them on for a few hours. If not for this issue I would give them 5 stars."}
{"label":5,"review":"Fits as expected.  It's been through the wash a couple of times with minimal shrinkage and the quality seems good.  Happy with the purchase."}

{"label":3,"review":"These are nice little gloves if a bit thicker than they need to be, as they are already warm, being of micro fleece. I got the one for size 7 hands (medium) and the thickness was perfect but they fit just barely in the length - my fingers push up against the top. The thumb is not free as on other brands, which is interesting since most people today need to use smart phones with these gloves. Since they have a lining, however, I was able to cut just the inside part of the thumb in the outside layer and higher up in the inside layer, so that my thumbs can get free but the layers will overlap when I want to cover up so cold air won't get in."}

The colours are perfect and it has an amazing shine to it, and comes tangle-free. The only thing is it isn't as curly as it is in the picture, but other than that it is a perfect wig and I would recommend it even if you weren't going to wear it for a certain character. I wore it because I just wanted to and it's truly amazing!"}

{"label":4,"review":"I love this dress. It is soft and pretty, not see-through, and it fits well (I'm about a 12 and there's some room to spare). My one issue with it is what some others have mentioned--parts of it are a little flimsy. The embroidered cloth on the front bodice had some frayed parts right out of the bag, and a few more showed up after a delicate wash and hang-dry. It was easy to sew them up, and the repair seams aren't noticeable, but it would have been nice not to have had to do it. Anyway, I'm really pleased with it overall and wear it often."}

{"label":2,"review":"Bought 4 of these, 2 in 2 different colors. Tried on one of the fawn colored ones, it was a bit large for a 38. I had to hook it on the second set of hooks to make it fit tight enough. It seemed to fit okay. A little bit of breast tissue was sticking out, but not much. Tried on one of the chocolate colored bras. Again, it was a little too large and more breast tissue was sticking out of the top. I just got fitted about a month ago (38G), so my size shouldn't have changed that much. I bought one cup size up thinking it would fit, and it doesn't. I still have muffin tops. Plus, both bras felt like they were made out of the cheapest materials.  The chocolate one even made creaking noises when I moved. I really needed some new bras, so even though I'm very disappointed I decided a few days later to try to make them work. (Plus I worked out on the treadmill for a few days before that...hoping it would help my cleavage somehow get smaller). So I tried the last 2 bras and the bands fit exactly like they should! Not too big. My breast tissue still sticks out sometimes, but I'm trying to lose weight and hope that will help the girls fit better. But I will probably never buy this brand again. I can't remember ever having a bra that felt so cheaply made as these feel."}

A 5 is extremely uncomfortable, but the 7 was a lot better. The 7 was maybe an inch or so too tight in the waist, but it was loose enough on my thighs and calves that I kept them. These will be hemmed in the leg because they are about 6&#34; too long. The pants have a bit of more flare than shown in the picture, and the pockets are a weird shape. The color is spot on. I don't love these pants, but I really like them. I would recommend them if you don't mind getting them hemmed."}

{"label":5,"review":"I would have liked it if Amazon didn't hold so firmly to its 30 day return policy, especially since I think they're going to send me a fruitcake at Christmas for being such a good customer. Oh, the jeans. They are fantastic. I've given up on Levis because the 501's have dropped so much in quality and Levi Straus has decided to pander to the young and beautiful set, with a low rise that can only look good if you have a butt and abs. At 69 I have neither and in the Wranglers, there is a very comfortable rise so that I don't show a plumber's crack (the only part of my butt I have left) when I bend over to pick up a quarter on the sidewalk. I first bought a Western Traditional George Strait Cowboy Cut in 38 x 34 and the fit was quite comfortable. I am 6' 2\\\\\" and 190. By the way, I found that the waist is true and the length runs a tad long, maybe an inch. I ordered the Boot Cut Slim to get a pair that would be a little slimmer in profile and in the butt and also to get a darker color of denim. (It would be great if Wrangler offered multiple colors for each type.) These Boot Cut Slims fit great, a little tighter and therefore not quite as comfortable than the regular Cowboy Cut. They are not \\\\\"skinny jeans\\\\\" by any means but do have a nice profile. If ordering go ahead and get your usual waist size, especially as these have some give with the Elastane. Also since they fit tighter, you'll want the extra inch in length so order your usual length."}

{"label":4,"review":"These are super comfy PJs, true to size, and the color is a really nice red. The only reason they don't get five stars is that the material is a bit on the thin side--and while that makes for nice sleeping, let's just say you wouldn't want to wear these around company without wearing a robe...or a bra if you catch my drift. So, unfortunately, these will only be worn when it's just me and hubby at the house, instead of when we have guests, which is what I had hoped to use them for. That said, they were still a good deal and I'm glad I bought them."}

{"label":4,"review":"We tried three different brands of organic cotton pajamas. These (the New Jammies), along with a set from Burt's Bees and Hanna Andersson.  Our son is just over a year old, generally around 80th percentile height and weight.  We bought the 18-month for the New Jammies and the 24 month for the Burt's Bees based on comments elsewhere on the fits of each.  Each has their pros and cons.  For example, we like the material on the Burt's Bees the best. It has the softest feel (although also a seemingly thinner fabric), followed by the Hanna Andersson. The New Jammies have a somewhat rougher feel (though still comfortable).  The fits of the New Jammies and Hanna Andersson are very similar. The torso is a good length, and the overall fit is somewhat snug (by design).  The Burt's Bees on the other hand are much looser (although we did buy a size larger on them, so that is likely why), but the torso is very short (compared side by side, the Burt's Bees 24 months is shorter than either the Hannas or New Jammies). Even though we bought a 24 months, the Burt's Bees shirt barely goes below his waist, and the loose fit means he has been able to wiggle an arm out of it.<br \/><br \/>Overall, considering the price, these would be my preferred brand of organic cotton pajamas. The fit is very good and while the material is not quite as soft as the Hannas, the cost is much more reasonable."}

I thought  it would be cheap looking, but its not. You have to order one size up, in order to get the right size. It took longer to get, so make sure you don't need it any time soon. I wouldn't bank on it! I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, because the waiting period was longer than I anticipated. Over all, its a nice jacket, for the spring, it does not cover very cold temperatures."}

It was exactly like i wanted and showed off my favorite Nintendo character. The shirt seems to be high quality with an official Nintendo seal, and since I love Nintendo, that just makes the shirt that much more loved by me. There are no visible flaw on the shirt that i can tell and it seems to be in mint condition. The only problem some might have is that the picture is not 100% accurate. The color of the shirt in person is slightly lighter than the color show above but everything else remains the same on the shirt. Overall it is a fantastic representation of Luigi and i could not be happier."}

{"label":3,"review":"I'm a 25 year old woman, and based on the other reviews for this Levi's juniors jacket, I bought a size up. For reference, I wear a 38D bra, weigh 145 pounds, 5'4, and wear a size 6 in women's clothing. I bought the medium in this jacket because I'm in the process of losing weight and figured worst case scenario I'd have to wait a few months before I could really enjoy the jacket.<br \/><br \/>Well, it fits now, but it's pretty tight in the shoulder area. I don't have the freedom of movement I have with my old blue jean jacket because of this tightness, and I'm unsure if losing weight will make that go away. I will also add that I'm unable to comfortably wear the jacket buttoned up. My chest is just too large for it to work without going up to a large. However, I wasn't crazy about the look of the jacket buttoned up, and I doubt I'll ever wear it buttoned even when it does become comfortable.<br \/><br \/>Other than that, the jacket is very attractive, and I think it'll look great with my summer dresses when the weather cools down a bit. There's no way I'll be able to wear a sweater under this jacket, but it's more for looks than for warmth anyway. I recommend it for juniors for sure. I think women should just proceed with caution when considering this purchase. You're taking a chance."}

Small size is fine for me, I have a medium too and it works fine. The material is stretchy and not supportive enough to be used as a sports bra, but it's not by any means flimsy or cheap feeling. Very nice. I agree with others though that you can fall out of it at night, you just have to be careful after nursing to pull it back over all the way so you don't fall out & leak all over. The only thing I didn't like was the seams on the sides, they could have taken the care to sew them down or cover them so they don't dig in... but it doesn't bother me enough to complain, it's still comfortable. If it bothers you you could probably just sew a ribbon over it or something and there would be no raw edges. Even with that, it's still the most comfortable bra I've found so far, and I do wear it around the house during the day as well."}

Perhaps if he'd had the benefit of a costume like this when he was little, he would have embraced our ambitions for him to become a tycoon, and gone on to support us in a style to which we could become accustomed.<br \/><br \/>I must note, however, that this costume strongly resembles the civilian attire worn by 'Lieutenant Fly' of Beetle Bailey, back in the early 70's."}
{"label":5,"review":"nice material, fit just perfect."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good price, they fit well in the legs except the waist- they were too large and loose. I didn't like how high they went either."}
{"label":5,"review":"Looks and fits as described."}
{"label":1,"review":"Not a good fit and the description I read before purchasing was nothing like what I received.  I returned this bra and will not purchase another."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought this bra for my elderly Mom who was having trouble reaching back and closing her back closure bra after pulling a muscle in her shoulder. She had a favorite style that she has worn for years and she was a little skeptical that any bra could offer the same support and comfort. She was happily surprised that this bra is not only much easier to put on but it also gives great support and is comfortable."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love it.  Love the colors .. just ap pictured and it feels just like silk.  I am so proud of my bargain."}
{"label":5,"review":"It looks like it is made out of very stiff material, however it is a stretchy material.  My son loves it.  He bought this for my wedding since we are doing a costume of your choice theme."}
{"label":5,"review":"Thank you for your fast service. They are a hit at my house."}
{"label":5,"review":"Dress is just as pictured. Very tight but the fabric is pretty thick so I can get away with wearing it as a dress by it's self. Love the lines, gives shape and dimension to my body. Love it!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Cute as can be.  Good quality."}
{"label":5,"review":"I wanted a sleeveless fleece for a recent trip to Alaska.  After perusing many options, this one seemed to fit the bill.  I was not disappointed.  It was warm enough for the cool fall weather in Alaska, was warm yet not too bulky for wearing, and the magenta was a good choice.  It would have been a bit bulky to pack, though, so I wore it while traveling.  The fit was good for me (small), but if one is between a small and medium, I would suggest the latter."}
{"label":5,"review":"A+ arrived very fast. Good quality"}
{"label":5,"review":"For what i paid compared to others it was a nice deal. im happy with the way it is and its not big deal for me to have the hooded version that is more like sasukes. it came when it was said to arrive, actually a day earlier, so shipping was good. the quality is nice. I'd say if you are a cosplay looking for a cheap but alright akatsuki robe then buy this one. nothing seems to be wrong with mine yet and ill be using it till it falls apart or i make my own."}

{"label":5,"review":"Switching back to boxer briefs, these are a great value. also fit and look good."}
{"label":5,"review":"Love this shirt.  Shipped much faster than I expected (I received it 12 days after ordering).  I am 5'5'' and usually a size 12-14, so I ordered a Large and it fits well.  Nice around the house but also stylish and long enough to wear with leggings for a casual look, and the sleeves fit me like normal sleeves, not 3\/4 sleeves.  The material is like sweat shirt material but without the bulk, so it's not incredibly warm but perfect for more temperate days.  I'm really happy and thrilled with this purchase, especially for the price!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Adorable and warm. Sizing is accurate. My 3 1\/2 year old loves these, they go up to just below her knee.  Well made. No complaints."}
{"label":4,"review":"I've washed it several times (gentle cycle in the washer and hang dry) and it's holding onto the glittery part of it.<br \/>It is way too small tho. I bought it size 2-4 for my 22 months old and it was tight for her (32&#34; and 25lbs). She's 24m now (almost 33&#34; and 26lbs) and I can barely put it on her for ballet class, I can't imagine a 3 or 4 year old fitting in this. So getting a size up is recommended.<br \/>Besides the sizing issue, it is super cute, it looks better in person and good quality."}
{"label":5,"review":"This top kindof keeps away moisture when working out. This is a long tee which is great when wearing super tight workout leggings, it hides things you wouldn't want people to notice. The fit of the tee is amazing it gives you room to breathe while working out instead of being tight and riding your curves. I'm gonna keep buying these tops!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I was a little disappointed, it din't fit very well."}
{"label":3,"review":"Hat is a little large for my head, so I wear a headband to give the hat a tighter fit. It works.  Overall, a nice looking summer hat."}

{"label":5,"review":"Although the hat is a little snug, it's perfect for shading my eyes when walking or driving. The fact that it looks great while doing it is a bonus."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great fall outfit...jacket is on the thin side but cute none the less"}
{"label":3,"review":"Waist seems to be a bigger than expected. Other than that they are as described."}

{"label":3,"review":"Bought for my dad for Christmas it fit the first two times he wore it but after got snug.<br \/>i liked it if you buy, buy a bigger size."}

{"label":4,"review":"I am very fat, so finding underwear that fits ain't easy. But these fit, and are worth the cash."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love those pants. They are very comfortable. The color goes with anything. Before I used to use it for bed. Now, I wear it all the time."}
{"label":3,"review":"These are a good size for the costume I need them for, but the quality is lacking. Right out of the package, the two layers of plastic fabric began to come apart at the edges. They're not glued together well at all. I'll probably fix it with some hot glue, so they're still usable, but it's annoying. The color and shape is good, though."}
{"label":5,"review":"love love love! Perfect colors, great quality! Highly recommend!"}
{"label":5,"review":"fit percfet thanks will purchase more soon"}
{"label":4,"review":"It's a shirt"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Material is somewhat see thru and it overall runs small.  Will keep for future but won't be able to wear now - too cold."}
{"label":4,"review":"It's always a guessing game when buying t-shirts.  You never know how the sizing will be, how long or large the sleeves are.  I like my t-shirts to fit, and this one is perfect.  I wear large shirts and bought this in a large.  Fit was snug in the arms and chest and didn't shrink after I washed it."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this. flattering and looks great!. I bought it in 2 colors-highly recommend."}
{"label":4,"review":"Wore with black suit\/black tie to wedding. Very classic and noticeable accessory added to the suit. Highly recommend. Love Kenneth Cole designs."}
{"label":4,"review":"Could've been a little big bigger. Luckly I went to dicks to try these on (different color) and realized they ran a little small. I'm not a fan of how the bottom area around the legs roll up but other than that I like them."}

{"label":4,"review":"I have three other previously-purchased BB Dakota faux wool coats and for some reason this one ran a bit smaller than the other ones, so that was a bit of a surprise, but considering how difficult it is to find faux wool pea coats, I am thrilled to have it.

{"label":5,"review":"Love it"}
{"label":5,"review":"Very good product. I like the design and the comfort.<br \/>I give 5 star because it's a good quality product and no cons at all."}
{"label":4,"review":"Fits perfect. Color is off... I would say it is more of a blonde than yellow. Curls look nice and it isn't thick. The bangs need to be adjusted and I need to let it sit out. Otherwise I love it!"}
{"label":5,"review":"The product fulfilled the expectations, thanks"}
{"label":5,"review":"Whoever designed this is a genius.  Linen is unforgiving, but this shirt has these narrow stretchy panels on the side that make the shirt so much more comfortable.  The color is beautiful as well.<br \/><br \/>I love Calvin Klein plus sized clothes.  I also have other items in my closet that I love from his line."}
{"label":5,"review":"A friend recommended this corset for post partum. My baby was born by emergency c-section and my body after this is taking some getting used to. My only regret is not having this to hand for straight after birth - just wasn't aware! I understand it can be used for normal birth as well and I would recommend it for anyone wanting to feel a little more confidence in their body not only for support but for aesthetics post birth. Yes the lines of the corset are visible through thin clothing, this doesn't bother me as quite frankly it looks better than the alternative in my eyes. I only bought one in medium (scary to do up at first but it gets easier!) but loved it so much I bought an additional bundle in med & small, in the hope I fit into the small someday, hope dies last!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I would say this fit more like a small rather than a medium.  But this is a nice color though."}
{"label":5,"review":"Got for my husband. He says its very comfortable."}
{"label":5,"review":"very happy..God Bless America!!!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Love the shirt. It has the cutest expression. the Ear issue (of it sagging) has been resolved on my shirt because they have stitched it up. The batwing sleeve also makes it pretty flattering.<br \/><br \/>I only did not give 5 stars for the shirt because this seller is horrible. Some stuff didn't come, others  were late, or totally not as described.<br \/>Cute stuff, but beware of the seller especially if you need follow up service."}
{"label":1,"review":"Very disappointed in the quality of this product. The emblem on front is basically a silk screen and so faded out that it's unrecognizable. It's certainly not what was portrayed."}
{"label":2,"review":"Sweater was very thin with strands loose all over edges! Sent it back right away, was afraid it would fall apart after 1 wash! Color was true and the shape was nice but the quality was very poor."}
{"label":3,"review":"Buckle is cheap"}
{"label":3,"review":"My son is 17 months old, but the swim shirt is already way too small for him, sliding up all the time. The orange on the print faded off after the first wash, staining the white sleeves. The print came\/peeled off after the second wear. But I absolutely love the shorts."}
{"label":2,"review":"Not really what it looks like in the picture. I didn't realize the top of the shirt and sleeves were black lace. Doesn't really go with the shirt and the lace fell apart after the first wash."}

{"label":2,"review":"Pretty cheaply made.  I used it as a costume for a play and it was fine.  We used it for three performances and a dress rehearsal.  I had to take it home and sew it twice.  Many of the buckles were hooked together, but not attached to the fabric"}
{"label":5,"review":"These fit my teen daughter perfectly. She loves that the demi curve ID means they were made for her body type which is different from her sister. Great color, cute skinny jeans."}
{"label":5,"review":"Very comfortable and doesn't show &#34;headlights&#34;...no embarassment. And holds up my girls nicely."}

{"label":5,"review":"This shirt I purchased for my niece.  She is a big fan of saying OMGLOB so I thought this was very appropriate.  The colors are great and I think people get the message of Lumping Off!!"}
{"label":5,"review":"theses socks are so cute but they do run big. my daughter is 4 and they seem like they'll really fit next year or so. I still think they are beautiful."}
{"label":3,"review":"Much smaller and tighter than the Jockey in the same size.  I will not buy these again."}
{"label":5,"review":"love it"}
{"label":5,"review":"I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear as the sizing would obviously be different, and it fits great! I probably could have just gone the 1 size up, but the extra material just makes it that much more comfortable. Wonderful material, amazingly soft. I ordered it February 1st and it arrived extremely early just two weeks later. Overall wonderful transaction as well as a wonderful product."}
{"label":5,"review":"I have the worst time finding pants that not only fit but also look good. These are really just the best. Super soft, form fitting without being &#34;skinny&#34; and dressy enough for the office while remaining casual enough i can go straight from work to the pub. I own 4 pair."}

{"label":5,"review":"I USED THE SIZE GUIDE, BUT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ME AND IT DIDNC'T SUPPORT THE GIRLS WELL. IT WAS SUPER COMFORTABLE, THOUGH! I'M ON THE SMALL SIDE, AND EVEN MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD IS LARGER THAN I AM!<br \/><br \/>GAVE THEM TO MY DAUGHTER, AND THEY DO WELL FOR HER. SHE'S ONLY ELEVEN, BUT NEEDS THE SUPPORT ALSO. SHE IS A HUSKY, SO THEY WORKED LIKE MAGIC CONTROLLING THE SIDES AND BACK. ALMOST DISAPPEARS! WILL CERTAINLY BUY MORE FOR HER."}

{"label":5,"review":"I have been a fan of these bras for 4 years.  I don't buy anything else."}
{"label":4,"review":"More like 4.5 stars, because I really like these jeans. I bought the size 34, fyi.  If I were looking to buy them again today, here is what I would want to know:<br \/>1. To call these a 34 waist is misleading, because they won't sit anywhere near your waist. I found the rise to be lower than any Levi's I own, 511s and 514s. The waist sits just below my hip bones. There is a bit of vanity sizing going on here though,  so even though I am wider around my hips than a 34, they fit rather nicely.<br \/>2. I'd read online that the inseam was 35 inches and I'd say that is accurate.  This is the uncuffed length, so don't think you're getting any extra length there, tall guys. Definitely shorter than my 36 inseam Levi's.<br \/>3. The left hand twill selvedge fabric is really nice. This was my first selvedge pair of jeans, and they feel very solid. Stiff at first, but they are beginning to soften in the areas I need them to after a week of wear.<br \/>4. The tapered fit is really nice for a guy like me with large thighs. The fit is much less constricting than my 511s and 514s, and they taper down so they aren't all baggy around the ankle.<br \/><br \/>Edit: 3\/24\/14<br \/><br \/>These jeans have stretched noticeably in the waist, but not in the length or leg circumference. I would not change my rating of these, it's just something to be aware of. If I were to buy them today knowing what I know now, I would probably size down one waist size to compensate.  I should mention that these jeans were tight in the waist when I bought them, so if you purchase these jeans and find them slightly too tight in the waist right off the bat, but perfect in the leg, give them a few weeks, and they'll be perfect.  Once the weather warms up, I'm going to do a warm water rinse just to see how they shrink.  I'll probably try to keep the inseam the same length by stretching it while I do this."}
{"label":4,"review":"For compression tights these are thin and did have me worried they wouldn't fit. When I opened package they looked like kids tights but they did expand and contour to the lines of my legs rather well. If you have a little bit of a belly the top band may be tight and wish to fold on you. I would say if your a perfect stick go with the exact size. If you have a belly or are female with larger hips... go up one size.<br \/>I am female of five foot three inch height and a weight of 154 pounds. Im a swimmer with large muscular thighs and a size medium contoured perfectly. Just have to deal with the band that is so so tight at my waist. I fold it down if too bothersome. I will try a bigger size soon to see the difference and add to this review my findings."}
{"label":5,"review":"It fits great and it is perfect for work or social events.  The fabric is also pretty breathable so it is great for the summer."}

{"label":5,"review":"Bought these skinny jeans and thought..&#34;oh no, I don't know if I will wear them enough&#34;!  I was wrong...I love them...they are bright and so summery looking.  Pair them with a black flowy blouse with heels and you have a day AND night look.  They are figure flattering and still give room in waistline with no muffin-top.  Stretch and comfy and fun to wear!<br \/>;"}
{"label":5,"review":"these are my favorite shirts"}
{"label":5,"review":"Filson is the BEST....I did return it for a wider version, but the same GREAT quality."}
{"label":4,"review":"Good value for the price. Color has not faded after a few washes."}
{"label":4,"review":"I'm happy with the purchase but I did not anticipate how slippery the fabric would be!  When my 7-mo old is in this I am constantly struggling not to drop her when I carry her around.  And she's not a wriggly baby.  If she was, I would really be in trouble!  I am still glad I bought this, though.  It is lightweight but VERY warm (I don't keep her in it for long car rides or she turns into a sweaty mess) and it is really easy to get on.  This is a huge plus when trying to negotiate getting out of the house with her and her 3 yr. old sister.  I haven't put her in the snow yet but that will be the true test.  Yes - this does run small.  I ordered the 12-mo size when she was 6 mos old because she's in the 75% for height and weight and one month later it is already starting to strain in the legs when she is seated.  I doubt it will make it through the whole winter.  Take this is into consideration when ordering."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this for my blue-eyed niece as a Christmas present and it's perfect.  The sweater is just the right length and can be dressed up or casual.  I love the tie waist and the hood too.  The material could be a tad softer but that doesn't really interfere with wear as you will want a shirt underneath the sweater."}
{"label":5,"review":"love it...it fits great and so far none of the beads have fallen off..I have only worn it once but will be waring it a few more times this summer"}
{"label":3,"review":"it is a very close fit my  breast are not holding  properly"}
{"label":1,"review":"Terrible. Fabric was not as expected. While interior had a thin fuzzy lining, the exterior was not at all what I would consider microfiber.  Felt more like a very heavy duty orthopedic sock. Daughter couldn't wear them. 7 yr old granddaughter thought they were too snug too.  Was looking for cozy socks, warm for the winner, not right uncomfortable orthopedic socks that don't breathe. If it wasn't such a hassle this time of year I would certainly return the two sets I bought."}
{"label":5,"review":"I just love it . So comfy and great fit."}
{"label":5,"review":"It is just as pictured.  We used it as a pretty parrot costume tail.  Colors are very pretty as pictured.  Maybe ours was just a tiny bit longer.  Fun!"}
{"label":1,"review":"These pants are absolutely terrible. Not only did they have a foul odor when I took them out of the packaging, the entire seam at the ankle busted open the second I tried to put them on. This effectively tore a hole around the entire back half of the ankle. It's almost like they're made of paper, because just a light tug will cause them to tear anywhere and the material feels extremely thin and delicate."}
{"label":3,"review":"This dress is cute and fits well.  It's not great quality, but I didn't expect it to be.  The zipper broke the first time I put it on.  Luckily I can sew, so I'll just put a new one in.  Disappointed that it couldn't even stay together for 5 min."}

{"label":5,"review":"I rated these a five because they are so cute and comfortable. I was worried about the one size fits all but they are perfect. I am a size 6-8 depending on the brand. They are as soft as pajamas but could certainly be dressed up or down. I am not sure how long they will last but at this price I will buy some more!!!!"}

{"label":1,"review":"I got these for my fianc&eacute;.  The fit is not as specified, even getting the size above what he typically wears was too small.  Item is not returnable, so I would not recommend buying this product."}
{"label":5,"review":"I really like the fit of these.  Since gaining a little weight, I decided to get a size larger than I normally would, and I chose correctly.  The slim fit combined with the larger waist fits JUST right, even the length is spot on.  I haven't washed them, so they are really stiff, and heavy duty.  I REALLY HOPE THE DON'T SHRINK!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Nothing really.  Find the underwear that you like and keep buying those ones.  These fit comfortably.  The sizing is true.  I like this brand because they are lightweight.  Some may say thin.  Lightweight is nice because they don't become uncomfortably hot in summer or in jeans."}

{"label":4,"review":"I bought these trainer for nighttime training my 3.5y old daughter. They are really really soft and the fit is ok. I also bought the potty patty which is more padded and apparently would hold more pee. My girl says these are more comfortable because she can close her legs completely which she can't with the PP, I don't know if these will hold so much at night but I will definitely get these when potty training a second Child during the day. One of them had a little stain like an off white one but I don't really care about that, they are really soft!"}

{"label":5,"review":"I chose 5 stars because it is a nice, stretchy, stocking material. I purchased this in secret, and, most importantly, I bought it for my own satisfaction. Any partner I wear this with will get quite a surprise ;)<br \/>  I feel gorgeous and sexy in this product. The only thing you need to be careful about with the material is when you first pull the material over your body, because the strips (that go down your backside) may fold over to the front. Be careful as to not rip or tear the strips. Just move them to the back and slowly pull it up down your body like a stocking. I wouldn't recommend pulling it up from your legs because the hips might stretch the sensitive material. It is a lovely snug fit. Nothing is baggy or loose, good secure packaging, and perfect for those who want to feel sexy for themselves, or entice their partner.  Unbelievably happy with this and I can't wait to use it~<br \/>Thanks, Rosemandy!"}

Also the straps were uncomfortable.<br \/>With the Playtex...it does not bother me at all.  It is a pleasure to wear.  I think that I could wear a D instead of a DD it is a little big on top of the cup.  But for everyday wear...I am very comfortable."}
{"label":5,"review":"great for newborn"}
{"label":1,"review":"It didn't look like the picture and was way to big."}
{"label":5,"review":"Ok I bought these for my husband. At first I thought they were weird. My husband was not pleased. He thought they were more than weird. First off they fit way different then any underwear he has ever worn so it took a bit to get used to for him. But that said he loves them now that he has worn them for a while. No longer does he have issues with rashes from heat. They don't stretch out like his boxer briefs. And I am hoping they don't blow out in the crotch like the boxer briefs after 2 months of wear. So far so good. I was them on delicate and hang them to dry. I would recommend them to anyone. They are great for him and not to bad for me to look at either."}

{"label":4,"review":"This wallet is significantly smaller and only slightly less functional than a standard bi-fold.      Cons:  It doesn't have a window for an ID, but to be honest I can't remember the last time someone checked my ID and didn't require that I remove it first.  Also the pockets in a standard wallet are a bit more functional than the clip.  This wallet isn't well suited to small receipts and coins.   Pros:  This wallet can hold a pretty substantial stack of bills without becoming uncomfortable and the outside card slots are quite convenient.  In my opinion the slot on the outside is more convenient than a standard ID window.    This is a reasonable quality wallet at a reasonable price.  Although I do wish the interior slots were made of cloth rather than leather to reduce width, you can't really wish for everything.  I would definitely recommend this wallet to anyone who is used to using a bi-fold."}

{"label":5,"review":"These things are amazing.  I wear them walking from the car into my office.  They do take a little time to get the fit down, but once you do they are great.  They fold up nicely and fit into my jacket pocket.  They definitely aren\u2019t going to be the warmest earmuffs out there, and the wind can come through the fabric, but they are great for the person on the go who can\u2019t wear a hat.  I have had mine for two years and will definitely be purchasing these again after I indubitably lose mine"}

{"label":4,"review":"I loved this skirt from the moment I saw it, and it was in my online cart about 30 seconds after. It's cute, it's fun, and it's cheap. When I got it, I was dismayed to find that the material wasn't really anything like &#34;faux leather&#34; and part of the hemming ripped soon after. Of course, it still looks great, and mine is currently being re-hemmed. Hopefully, this time it'll be a little firmer and stronger. Overall, it's a good buy, what you pay is what you get. I precaution you, it might be in need of resewing, but I still think it's great. It's a fixer upper, but I don't regret what I bought."}

This slim wallet is perfect..and now attached to him by the chain. No more leaving it at the store..or in the car when he goes to pay at the checkout counter..lol.<br \/>  P.S. His nickname since he was a kid is Dickie.. now he has a wallet with his name on it."}
{"label":4,"review":"I'm usually a small\/medium and the small fits perfectly.  The quality is what you pay for.  The fabric was a bit thin.  I bought the purple dress and could see a white bra shine through.  It feels like it will probably lose it's luster after a couple more wash and wears.  It will then become a good cover up."}
{"label":4,"review":"Just one little blip. The product tag is in the front of the pants. Being accustomed to the tags being in the back I was putting the pants on backwards. They weren't fitting at all. The only thing that clued me in was the stitching on the pockets.  LOL."}
{"label":5,"review":"Exactly what I was looking for!  Nice reversible feature and I like the quality of this leather belt.  I've used other leather belts and they bleed if you sweat.

The fabric and color are also very nice and the length is perfect. I can definitely see myself wearing it with a nice dress for the holidays or in the spring."}

I usually wear a medium and ordered a large to err on the side of caution. It's like a tent on me; even the medium would probably be comfortably baggy, not tight at all. Seriously, just use the sizing chart and keep in mind your usual size. I'm not going to send this back because that's a hassle and it's not the seller's fault anyway.<br \/><br \/>VERY soft fabric. It felt like butter in my hands when I first touched it. Some describe it as thin, but I disagree. I live in the southern U.S., and this is thick enough for casual outings in the winter."}

I will update when I get them.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: I did size up to a 20, and while they are actually still a bit tight in the waist, I will probably keep them because I am sure they will have a little more give as I wear them and they fit perfect everywhere else, and they make my butt look great... but I have to say that I am SERIOUSLY MIFFED about the fact that this pair has no branding on it at all! The little red \\\\\"LEVI\\\\\" tag on the back pocket, just has the little \\\\\"R\\\\\" circle... no word \\\\\"LEVI\\\\\". I am leery that they are knockoffs or something. I want to be able to resell if I loose some weight, and I don't like that they are not branded. Maybe this is new?"}

It looks just like it does in the picture, except mines one solid color, none of that shading towards the top of the picture. I am a country guy, so I wear buckles every day, and this one has a really nice quality hook for the belt holes, it is bigger at the bottom so it stays where you put it. Nice loop to put the belt through,sturdy buckle! GREAT BUCKLE FOR THE PRICE!!! It's not gold, but who needs to wear gold when you've got this bad ass buckle on!"}

{"label":5,"review":"This dress is as adorable as I hoped! It also arrived very quickly. I normally wear a medium-large in dresses (normally around a size 8, large to make room for my boobs) but since this dress is stretchy in the back I got the medium. I'm 5'5, 150 pounds and wear a 36 C. It was slightly tight on top with a bra so I'm wearing my adhesive cups to give me an extra boost! The only thing about the dress that I wasn't too happy about is the straps are pretty short so they are a bit on the tight side. The sides also gape open under my arms quite a bit but this dress is so cute and flattering that it doesn't bother me too much! I almost bought a petticoat for underneath but it doesn't really need it. It flares out nicely! I also love that the material is light so this dress is perfect for summer. I bought this for my birthday party and it is just what I wanted! For the price this dress is amazing since this style of dress can be expensive! I highly recommend!  :)"}

{"label":1,"review":"This corset is made with acrylic bones. Acrylic boned corsets do not work nearly as well as steel boned corsets and are usually made for costumes or corset-shirts, NOT for shaping the body. They are flimsy and do very little permanent shaping and much less immediate shaping than a steel boned one. Think about it, you're trying to change the shape of your body, why use a material that can't do it as well. Not only that but steel boned corsets are more flexible and comfortable. I made the mistake of buying this corset because I typed in steel boned and this came in the results for some reason. Once I realized my mistake (30 mins later) I tried canceling my order. THEY WOULDN'T LET ME! It said that my order was already being processed but I don't see how it's being processed after 30 minutes... I'm going to try to return it but you have to pay for shipping! I sent them a message asking for cancellation and it hasn't been responded to yet. I found a similarly priced 24(!!!) steel boned!!!) corset on Amazon for 23$ that looks, in my opinion, more stable and attractive. I seriously regret buying this product and I hope I helped someone out by making this review so they don't make the same mistake I did. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00IGVB0H2\/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A2B0VG3QZ4MYCW &#60;&#60; this is the corset I am going to try to get if shipping it back to them isn't too much money."}

The part with the most room would be the sleeves in the upper arms. I wish it were a bit smaller as I could probably fit numerous sweaters underneath, which I planned on doing, but room is a bit too sufficient in this case.<br \/><br \/>That being said, it feels pretty warm and I have no doubts that it will keep me toasty in the coming months.<br \/><br \/>I'm going to sleep on it and decide later."}

So glad I did!<br \/><br \/>-The material has a nice subtle pattern and sheen without being too busy.<br \/>-Skirt has a higher waist, so it sits at natural waist and not on hips to make it a more classy fit.<br \/>-Jacket is very nicely structured so it nips in just under the bust to flatter curves.<br \/><br \/>I was more than pleasantly surprised by this purchase. I debated on giving the suit 4 or 5 stars but went with 4 because I think the price is a bit high...but I'd buy this brand again in a heartbeat as the construction of the suit is so well done."}

The metal pins DID NOT easily pierce my Jean's fabric, but that is a very minor point.  Get an ice pick, small nail, or even a small phillips head screwdriver to punch a small hole in your jeans.  The pins are made of aluminum and bend easily.  Another option is to buy the &#34;#1 Popular 17mm Bachelor Jean Buttons, Set 50 with Tool by DIMEBUTTONS.&#34;  The tool that comes with them will help prevent bending the pins or driving them in at an angle.  The buttons in both are the same size and are probably standard size, however I would prefer a little smaller size for ease of buttoning the suspenders."}
{"label":4,"review":"For the price I have been unable to find a better brief. They are lighter weight than what I would prefer but they seem to hold up to many washings with no problem. I like the fact that the waist band holds up with no puckering or loss of holding power. They do run smaller than the sizes suggest which is not a problem if you are aware of this and order a larger size."}

I needed a size that wasn't listed as an option here, so I wrote to the seller and asked for my size.  They didn't have the four-button in my size, but he was able to find me a near-exact suit (3 button) instead.  It's rare that you get such personalized service on Amazon.<br \/><br \/>The suit itself is really nice. I'm not going to be using it very often, so I was willing to settle for an average quality suit for this price.  I was surprised when I got it, in that it was much nicer than expected.<br \/><br \/>The suit also came on a really clever hanger. There's a flexible\/snap piece of plastic that holds the pants in place.  I've seen similar ones like this, but it's usually a bar on a hinge.  This pants holder doesn't come apart like that, it just snaps upward and then downward with no bars or hinges. Very handy especially if you'll be packing the suit around or traveling with it.<br \/><br \/>You really won't find a suit of this quality, for this price, with this kind of service ANYWHERE else...online or regular store."}

Sell these as children's dresses. My daughter is 12, extremely slender, and the XXL fit her perfectly."}
{"label":5,"review":"I've tried on Lucky and True Religion jeans and was seriously underwhelmed by how they looked and fit, especially considering the crazy price tag. Last weekend I was at Garden State Plaza mall and saw a Joe's Jeans store. I'd never even heard of the brand but decided to check them out. I tried on multiple pairs and discovered that the straight ankle in a size 30 fit me as well as a non custom pair of jeans possibly can (I'm really curvy on the bottom half with short legs and a small waist). Not to mention they're $165 compared to the $208 price tag on a pair of true Religion jeans.<br \/><br \/>I liked them so much I decided I wanted another pair, but I was just visiting my parents in Jersey, I live in DC. So I went online. The brand's website does offer free shipping, but free shipping usually equals slow shipping, so I was thrilled to discover that Amazon carried them.<br \/><br \/>The jeans I bought in the store are a size 30 in the straight ankle cut and a dark wash. So I was a little surprised to discover that these felt slightly tighter when I put them on, when supposedly the wash is the only difference. But since they're not custom I figure irregularities are going to happen. They're certainly not too tight by any means and I'm so happy to have them. Thanks Amazon prime!"}

I make many purchases on Amazon, so I find this to be rather annoying.    UPDATE:  The kind people at Amazon customer service went ahead and gave me a refund, and let me keep the onesies, too.

They are a nylon mesh, and I got them for travel, and they are very light and can be compacted well into your suitcase.<br \/>The front is double lined, so it isn't quite as revealing as you might think a mesh is.

The product runs a little smaller than the size stated on the chart. So the large fits me just fine. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. I washed it by hand and drip dried as I do my other tights. It did not wrinkle and since it is a tight it conforms to your body anyway. It is good for any kind of workout. It did not give me any rash. But I washed it before wearing.  The only difference I see from the synthetic products is that it doesn't tuck my tummy as well as the other tights. But, it is a good product and I recommend it. I was getting a rash from the synthetic tights but I found if I was them several times and rinse well I don't break out. So for me either type is okay. As for shipping it arrived on time and in great condition."}

The colors are great too, they really remind me of the Scooby Doo cartoon.<br \/><br \/>Bad points: The dress is very long, compared to the picture, and to what it's supposed to be, it arrives mi-calf, just above the end of the \\\\\"boots\\\\\". I will have to cut it to make it arrive above the knee, like the real Daphne's dress. The boots-tops don't have a shiny plastic aspect like they have on the picture, they're just simple pink fabric, so I'm going to try find real 70's boots, because it just looks as if I had socks and no shoes.<br \/><br \/>The wig doesn't have the shape it is supposed to have. The curls ciuld be really nice, but it shortens the hair a lot, they don't even touch my shoulders; and the fang is curly too, which is adorable but doesn't look like Daphne at all.<br \/><br \/>And the neck-scarf is missing, I will have to buy one."}

On one side are 3 slots for credit cards plus a clear ID window, with space for bills underneath the flap.  On the other side is checkbook slot with the requisite carbon copy shield.  I rated this according to its quality and functionality, even though in my case I actually need the thinnest possible checkbook cover to fit inside my minimalist travel wallet.  I won't discount stars due to the fact I can't use it for my specific application, but if I ever need a checkbook that can stand alone without a purse or wallet, this is the item I'll turn to.  Would also make a nice gift."}

{"label":5,"review":"I love this dress; it's attractive and comfortable at the same time.  I agree with the other reviewers who said that the fit was more appropriate for people with smaller frames.  Though rated as being &#34;one size&#34; and having adjustable straps and an elastic, stretchy back which makes it a little more forgiving on size, the dress nonetheless seems made more for a petite person.  I'm 5'0&#34; and under 120 pounds, and it fit me like a glove, if not a slight bit snug in the torso.  So I can't say I'd recommend it for larger frames, but if you're slim and have a small frame, it should fit pretty well.  As to its other attributes...the material is just the perfect weight; it feels as though it will last for quite a while with this sturdy mid-weight fabric.  It hangs nicely, is well-designed and makes for a nice boho-chic look."}

However, I discovered with my recent purchase that the socks are not the same as those that I have purchased previously.  In my opinion the quality has declined, the socks seem thinner, are less comfortable, and have more of a synthetic feel.  Sorry GoldToe, I will be looking at different brands for my future purchases."}

They are made out of a nice weight of denim that isn't too heavy, but not too thin, either.  The red is surprisingly easy to match tops with.  It looks great with neutral colors like white, cream, grey, and black, but also works well with blue and yellow.  These are my favorite jeans right now!"}

I can't believe it was even included in the package.  The side seem want at a diagonal across the front so that the front and back did not meet at all.  It cannot even be used on a doll.  I will not order these again, and if it wasn't such a hassle I'd package them up and return them."}

The only drawback is a lack of elastic or adjustments along the sides for rib cage expansion, otherwise these are perfect!  Though the price was very good!"}

I wanted it to fit perfect and go just below my knee and it does. It's so beautiful. My daughter wanted me to twirl because she thought it was like a princess. So normally I wouldn't give my measurements but it if it helps someone buying this dress I'm glad to help. I'm 5'7 and I weigh 137. My measurements are 37, 33, 37.

{"label":4,"review":"I bought these for my husband and he wears them pretty frequently now. He is an XL in most things, but this set was a little large on him. After the first wash, it shrunk a little, but the large size doesn't matter much with pajamas. They are still very comfortable and look very nice. They do need ironing if you care about pajamas that aren't wrinkled."}
{"label":3,"review":"I ordered this along with the Angel-fashions Women's 3\/4 Sleeve Lace dress to compare. I personally like the cheaper on better. It was more comfortable, better made, also more flattering, I returned this. Overall it was nice, it just was not what I was looking for."}

{"label":3,"review":"The quality is good, but sizes are smaller then regular belts in a store. In other words, if all my pants and belts are 34, then I should order 36 or 38size to fit me. Also, you have to pay for return shipping."}

The soft microfiber that conforms perfectly to me and really do feel \\\\\"barely there\\\\\". I must have discovered these a good 20 years ago, and have never worn any other kind since. I've tried other brands on occasion, but haven't been happy with any of them and always end up tossing them. None can compare to these. The only bad thing I can say about them is that the high-cut style is becoming increasingly harder to find. There is a note with this seller stating that this style is being replaced with Bali 303J. I hope they read this and know that I will not be buying from them again when that happens."}

{"label":5,"review":"this is the first chronograph watch I purchased--and these were my first thoughts.<br \/><br \/>1.  the watch looks as shown on the website.<br \/>2.  seller delivered watch promptly and in proper packaging.<br \/>3.  watch is good weight and size for wrist.  41 mm case.<br \/>4.  the chronograph sweep hand lines up with the minute markers on face of watch.  (I've bought some watches where this was not the case and it was extremely annoying.)<br \/>5.  Watch met my personal requirements:  (a) wear it with jeans and t-shirt on weekends; and (2) suit and tie for work.  This watch looks good in either situation.<br \/><br \/>The only concern I had was the price--it seemed to be too good.  I googled the model number and found that the price listed on Amazon was about 50% lower than the price listed on major department store websites.  I was worried the product I was buying on amazon was either refurbished, a returned item, a knock-off, or had some defect.  However, the watch appears to be the real McCoy, new, unworn, and operates as it should.<br \/><br \/>If anything changes, I will update this review.  But as of now--this watch hit all the sweet spots for my budget and personal requirements.  That's why I gave it 5 stars."}

{"label":4,"review":"This is a super flattering bathing suit. I'm 49 years old and a size 14-16 with an hourglass figure and this suit looks great on me--defines my waist while  (somewhat) concealing my belly. I'm a D cup and while the bust fits, larger busted ladies should beware. It's more revealing than I usually like but the overall effect of the suit is so flattering that I'm putting up with it. This suit is very inexpensive and it shows in the workmanship--this is not a suit that will last you more than one season and is definitely not the suit to wear if you're a serious swimmer. But If you just want to look cute at the beach or pool this will do nicely."}

It's biggest plus is in keeping the wheel cool in the summer.  This is my second wheel cover and it's by far softer than the previous one.  No problem installing it, just remove it from it's shipping envelope,  unknot it and pop it on.  This company shipped promptly and kept me advised of the shipping status.  I'd recommend them as a great Amazon marketer.  I'll probably try their other products such as seat covers and seatbelt pads when my present ones wear out."}

{"label":5,"review":"Just ordered my second batch of these T-shirts. More expensive than my usual 100% cotton choices from the local stores, but the texture and 'feel' of these are preferable to me. Very comfortable to wear AND they seem to be more resistant to the affects of underarm deodorant."}
{"label":2,"review":"I did not care for this top nearly as much in person as I did in the photo.  It gives the impression of belling out away from the hips a bit which it does not do in person.  The length seems longer on the model, though I am 5'2\\\\\" so I'm not a giantess by any stretch of the imagination.  The neckline is much rounder in person as well, so overall it will not work in the outfit I purchased it for.  It is a t shirt, plain & simple with a bit of twist detail @ the neck.  I feel that I could have found something @ ON for half of this price."}

So I ordered my regular size M and to my surprise it fit perfectly. It isn't too small and doesn't cling the way a normal t-shirt dress would, the fabric is very soft but substantial, you can't see through it in the sun and the length is perfect. I've worn it by itself and it's really cute with jeans. It's slightly whimsical and yet the quality gives it a touch of class.  <br \/>I'm impressed! I think I may be onto something!"}

{"label":5,"review":"These leggings are very smooth, comfortable, and so adorable!  I absolutely love them.  Order them according to the sizes given, a large is an 8-10, and this is definitely how they fit.  I do wish they were just a inch or so longer, I am 5'10&#34; and they come to just above my ankles.  These are not thick leggings like other athletic leggings I have ordered, they are very lightweight, but not at all sheer.  I can't wait to wear them to yoga (without fear of showing my knickers!), and they look great with regular clothes as well.  Very pleased!"}
{"label":2,"review":"I initially really liked this. Fit her well, felt great to the touch and i had made up my mind to buy a million more of these as she grew. HOWEVER, after only being worn twice, 2 of the snaps on the leg have just fallen off. My baby is 2 month old, so its no like this outfit has been through rough times. All she has done in it is sleep. I am very disappointed and will be contacting seller to try and figure this out. If that happens ill update review."}

{"label":1,"review":"I am absolutely, 100%, disappointed in this product.  I normally do not write reviews, but I am so upset about this product that I decided to.  I first bought the &#34;bubble&#34; socks about 3 years ago for my first daughter and loved them.  They were great quality and about the only socks that stayed on her little baby feet.  So, when I saw these &#34;bubble&#34; socks on amazon, I was thrilled, as I could not find them anywhere!  When they arrived, they did not look quite the same, and that is because they aren't!  They are NOT the same quality as 3 years ago!  They are cheaply made, thin cloth (not the thick cloth as in previous styles), and DO NOT stay on her feet.  I bought these when my daughter was 3 months old and they are TOO SMALL!  They do not even fit over her small feet.  I wish I could get my money back, but I already opened them and threw away the packaging.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you are looking for the &#34;bubble socks&#34; from a few years ago, you will be highly disappointed and waste your money.  Who ever redesigned these socks truly did a disservice to the product.  I'm sure they decided to ship them off to China and used cheaper, lesser quality materials.  I bought the larger socks also. They are just as bad."}

{"label":3,"review":"I ordered a medium in black and it is almost too small for me. I am 5'9 and 145lbs so it's not that I'm overweight or anything, but length wise it was tugging at my neck so much just because I guess it was manufactured for people with a shorter torso. I suggest ordering a size up if you are taller than average. Also, shipping was very fast."}

A \\\\\"large\\\\\" would have been way too big in the shoulders and length of sleeves. It looks great on him and is cozy and warm."}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a cute suit with a little rockabilly sass. I only gave it 4 stars b\/c the top is a little small. I don't have a huge bust for my size and I spill out of this top.

As received they were too stiff to be used this way.<br \/><br \/>I immediately hand-washed them in cold water and liquid clothes detergent. The colors bled a little into the wash water. I recommend you hand wash them separately, or in order of lightest to darkest.  I then put them in the dryer with Bounce fabric softener sheets, doing the light ones separately from the dark.<br \/><br \/>They came out usably softer. Not &#34;soft&#34; like a pillowcase, but much better. There was some fraying.<br \/><br \/>Drying shrunk them down to about 21&#34; x 21&#34;, some a little smaller. While still usable as head bandanas for me, they are almost too small.<br \/><br \/>Summary:<br \/>- Bright colors as advertised.<br \/>- Was able to get most of the stiffness out.<br \/>- Didn't shrink too much.<br \/>- Frayed a little in drying.<br \/>- I rate these a good value."}

But most importantly, the fit was always too tight in plus sizes. I wanted to buy a belt, not a corset!  Well, I just bought a new dress that screamed \\\\\"I need a belt\\\\\", and I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Amazon.com. I was still worried about the sizing but took a chance anyway.  This belt is spot on! It fits well, has nice elastic that holds but doesn't bind, and the faux front piecework looks really good.  Is it 'amazing'? No..., rarely things at this price point are ever amazing. But what it is, is a very nice, well made, well fitting, good looking belt for the money. This looks really good with my new dress and the rhinestones are a nice touch... sparkly but not overly done (these are dark stones). I like it so much, I'm ordering another style from this same company."}

It is a tad short, but this leggings or spanx underneath, it's no big deal."}

I washed it in the washing machine 3 times so far and the baby has worn it 3 times and it has held up great. It does leave a shiny fabric threads on everything (the outfit worn under the costume and other clothes in the wash) but that wasn't a big deal. The ears seemed slightly smaller than pictured to me while the opening for the head seemed larger."}

{"label":5,"review":"Got this for my granddaughter.  She received one as a gift and I thought this was a perfect sleep\/play wear-not too heavy but light enough where she is comfortable.  She is walking more now so the footless design helps her get around without slipping.  Can't beat the price so I picked up a few larger sizes to have around."}

It washes like a sheet and comes out of the dryer with the customary wrinkles. I don't bother ironing my nightgown and love its for travel too. I love long sleeves on my nightgown and love the length of it too. The details and embroidery on this nightgown are lovely."}

I didn't understand why these said two pocket, I guess it means the fly doesn't open. I wear a 34 in briefs but for these anything less than XL\/XG is too tight. I love the material their made from, strong but light. My wife loves they way I look in them, kinda like spanx for men and she says they hold my bulge up front and center so she can oggle me at any distance. They're all I wear around the apartment."}

{"label":5,"review":"I love these pants. I'm just starting out in my nursing career and have been trying many types of scrubs to find the style that fits me and looks best on me. So far these are the winner (have also tried Dickies Gen Flex cargo and WonderWinks). I love the yoga pant top. I'm 5'7, 145lbs and I bought the medium tall. Usually regular scrubs flood terribly on me, I guess my legs are long. I think if I had to buy these again though, I would go with regular length. The bottom of these pants are dragging the ground on me and will have to be hemmed. That's a minor problem though, and I would rather too long than too short. They have washed really well so far."}

Just to give you an idea of sizing, I am a dress size 4 (5'3\\\\\" 119#) and the size small fits me perfectly.<br \/><br \/>Things to be aware of:<br \/>1. It is a bit thin on the bottom, as reviewers noted below. You'll need a slip or no-show undies.<br \/>2. The top is too thin to be able to go braless and the back is kind of low for a strapless bra, so you'll probably need pasties.<br \/>3. It seems to be a bit longer than I think Marilyn's was. I am considering trimming and\/or hemming mine."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love these shirts. They fit me really nicely. I'm an avid cyclist and very athletic and this shirt brings out my frame very nicely. You need to be athletic for this shirt to really look nice on you. It also forces me to keep up with my fitness. Whenever my tommy starts popping out of these, I know it's time to do some ab crunches."}
{"label":1,"review":"The arm bones are on the inside of the sleeve, such that they are hard to see and you can't rotate the sleeves because of the gloves.  Furthermore, when the costume arrived and I went to unfold it from the packaging, the paint sticks to itself and peels off.  I was willing to spend some extra money to get a good skeleton costume, but this was not it!"}

{"label":1,"review":"The material is soft but very cheap. When I first opened the product, it looked like the size shorts a cabbage patch doll would wear. After trying them on, I saw that they fit comfortably but the material stretched so thin it became see through. This is not worth the money spent."}

They seem a bit short and also like they don't stretch after wearing for an hour like jeans w elastane usually do so get the size you usually wear and not one smaller. plan on wearing not much higher than 2.5\\\\\" heels if you are 5'7\\\\\""}
{"label":5,"review":"I work in a conservative field within the education system. I could wear these skirts everyday because they are mid-knee length, just wear a slip under the lighter color skirts. I purchased the cream...it's beautiful! And I received the skirt within six days, but it was very wrinkled so I just put it on the delicate cycle. I'm currently wondering if I need to buy the brown, gray, white, and black...it's such a classic skirt that it will not go out of style just take care of it. Although I admire the chiffon skirts, the material this skirt is made of is more durable...probably a polyester crepe...which is good because I work with kids so they'd probably rip it. I ordered a medium and it fits just right...a large would have been too big. I'm a US 8-10 and a UK 12-14."}

{"label":4,"review":"These pants are pretty great. They're soft and yet, Carhartt durable. They work well on casual day at work, then in the yard on the weekend. Only issue, they fit a bit long in the leg and a little large in the waist. Just to be clear, they do not sit on hips in the style of today. They are a more classic waist fit. In other words, from belt loops to crotch seem, they're deep (or long)."}
{"label":2,"review":"Great if you only use cotton pants but otherwise does not work on other materials."}
{"label":5,"review":"This was a gift for my sister, who said the fabric was much nicer than most tshirts she has.  She's a petite adult, but I bought a large junior size... luckily, she said it fits perfectly.  Sorry I can't send you a photo of my sister to help you gauge your size choices!"}
{"label":4,"review":"The dress is made of 100 % cotton, it appears more polyester in the picture, which would hang better. I am only 5ft 1in. so I need to have it hemmed just a little and of course ironed. Also a slip may be necessary.<br \/>I was a bit disappointed in the color. It is not a bright yellow but a gold with white squares. I am going to Costa Rica so it will be fine for my purposes."}
{"label":2,"review":"The material looks nice. It didn't fit like the model, it was quite large at the top and somewhat tight on my hips. I am 34A, 120lbs. I got a size 8. I guess it will fit the busty type. It didn't look nice on me."}
{"label":5,"review":"Per the other review, I ordered several sizes up-- which was a mistake!  The sizes listed are absolutely accurate. The XXL, when cinched completely tight, measures exactly 31 inches at the waist-- just as the size chart advertises!<br \/><br \/>I loved this corset so much, though, that I immediately went ahead and ordered another in my size.  The faux leather is wonderfully soft to the touch, and does not come with the awful smell I usually associate with PU Leather.  The corset seems quite well constructed.<br \/><br \/>Can't be beat for $19!"}

He has to deal with a lot of stone, grout, etc... and even though he works outside in Hawaii, in the heat, and humidity... he has to wear long sleeves for protection and he needs hi visibility color. He LOVES Carhartt shirts. And he LOVES this orange shirt. I sent him some yellow and green ones (other brands) and he did not like them anywhere near as well as Carhartt. He now buys EVERYTHING from Carhartt. His pants, his boots, his belts, his shirts. EVERYTHING. It is very high quality.<br \/><br \/>My only complaint is that we often can't find his size because it is completely sold out online and in stores. Great demand for a great product."}

I have a heck of a time finding clothes online but usually wears 2t-3t pants and 3-4t shirts from old navy. We use it to go to the park and up at my dads where the temp us usually 10\u00b0 colder. It also doubles as a mud guard. His movement us slightly hampered but not enough for him to fuss about. Overall will was a great purchase and cheaper than others that seem worse quality!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I got lots of compliments when I wore this dress last weekend. Very cute design, a little stiff at first. But I always wash my clothes before wearing them. After a wash and dry, it was great. Very comfortable. I'm 5'2\\\\\", 125 lbs and the dress hit just a little below my knees. Not tight, but it also didn't slip down. It also held my strapless bra in place. Not sure if I could\/should\/would go braless with this dress. At a 36D, that just doesn't seem like a good idea. Also, I have a little pregnancy pooch left over (who doesn't) and it covered it up nicely. I'll probably order more in other colors. Highly recommend!"}
{"label":3,"review":"The pants are bit flimsy and see through so we replaced them with a plain pair of black slacks, however the rest was not that bad, bought the costume to dress it up with rave paint so was happy with the plain nature of the costume."}
{"label":4,"review":"I purchased a few of these, one size larger, for 3 different people (bought l,  xl ).  The thin cotton fabric feels smooth to the skin and is comfortable.  After a first washing and shrinking, the black colored fabric was well maintained, and it had no odor.  These shirts fit our bodies well, leaving ample but not excessive space.  It is the perfect shirt to wear by itself, with a jacket\/windbreaker,  or as an undershirt.  Great for the price.<br \/><br \/>pros:  fits well after washing<br \/>maintains color (blk)<br \/>fabric feels comfortable to skin<br \/>price<br \/><br \/>cons:  runs a little small<br \/>fabric on the thin side<br \/><br \/>Yes, I would recommend these."}

{"label":5,"review":"I am absolutely in love with these shorts! You see, I'm not very blessed in the rump region, so it's hard to find pants that actually look good on me. I was pleasantly surprised when these shorts accentuated my features instead of just hanging off of me. They are form fitting, yet not tight at all. The material is super soft and stretchy, and is thick too; none of that thin stuff that gets holes in it easily. They have a thick waistband along with a drawstring closure to ensure that you get the best fit possible.( I personally just flip the band down on mine as I find that they look better this way.) I purchased the pink color and it is very vibrant and pretty! My husband actually compliments me every time I wear these, which makes me love them even more. After repeated washings they still fit great and the color is just as beautiful as the day that I got them. I'll definitely be ordering more in all of the colors!<br \/><br \/>Discounted for evaluation"}

{"label":4,"review":"I actually bought these for myself - finding cute, white mittens as an adult can be tough so I frequently check out the kids section. Unfortunately, these are just a tich too small for my hands (& at 5'1&#34; I have little hands) so I'd say these are probably better for the lower end of the range listed (more like 7-10). My oldest daughter is 7 and they fit her fine - she is on the tall side of 7 (95% on the charts) and wears a size 10\/12 for most of her clothes. They are quite soft & the &#34;fur&#34; isn't ratty looking, which is something I was concerned about, and is very teddy bear like in softness. I think having the palm the knit just makes sense - white fur would get nasty incredibly quickly if it was on the &#34;business&#34; side of mittens. All in all, I'm not sorry I got them. My 7yo can wear them & eventually my 4yo will grow into them - and maybe they'll eventually stretch them out a bit so I can steal them back. ^_^"}

I bought several pair for the purpose of cutting off one pant leg, as I have a broken leg and wanted some cheap pants to get my cast through easily.  These have been perfect, and comfy too.

It is organza and the dress comes folded several times to minimize packing, so just understand that it will be a little rumpled and you will have to iron or steam it.  It is worth it, because the same dress in other sites cost at least 30% more."}

I wear a 10 but at a size 12 suit, I was struggling to pull it up and not have it stretched to the max.  I am 5'9 and have long legs and torso.  I exchanged for a 14 and that fixed the length problem but the material around the bum was so loose that it kept riding up when I walked.  If you are a little shorter, this might work for you.  You should also be relatively small chested.  The bathing suit looks like you can fall out of it very easily.  I would say it is the type for pool parties or laying out. Not for doing laps at the gym or jumping into pools.  Keep this in mind if you are over a 'B' cup.  There just isn't enough material but the quality is definately there."}

If you want a thick scarf for snowblowing, this is not for you, and you should think about something other than cashmere.  But, if you want a cashmere scarf to wear with a dressy overcoat, this is for you.  As to the price, real 100% cashmere is expensive.  This is not a cheap blend of man-made fabrics blended with a spit of cashmere.  It's all about what you want, and this is what I wanted."}

{"label":5,"review":"Now, I rated this a 5 star because this was a cheaper alternative to the &#34;nu bra&#34; which is way more expensive. The purpose for this bra is to be able to wear it alone but the reason I purchased this was to get an extra &#34;oomf&#34; when I wear my strapless bra. I saw this method from a youtube video. My strapless bra lacks any sort of &#34;lift&#34; that a push up bra provides. I wore a beautiful strapless dress for an event and this &#34;un bra&#34; gave me the lift I wanted. And I placed my strapless bra over it so there was no worry for it falling off. I loved it! I wore it the next day as well for another event under another strapless bra\/dress. I haven't tried wearing this alone because my dresses weren't backless or anything. But wow this bra really makes your twins look amazing :-) Keep in mind I did have a strapless (un-padded) bra over it. This might seem redundant and you might be thinking &#34;then why didn't you just purchase a padded strapless bra instead?&#34; I have a couple of those too obviously, but believe me, this is much more effective. I thank the youtuber that taught me this trick :-P"}

I am however, very pleased with the quality of the cotton. It has a great stretch, but doesn't get baggy.  The color has remained after washing and they are very soft and cozy.  They are a big small for their sizing.  I would order these up one size if you have ANY questions. (baby is 12 mo, 23 lbs and is 30.5&#34; tall) she is tall and big, but I ordered up one size and they are still a little snug."}
{"label":2,"review":"The dress is too small and I was not given clear directions as to how to return it.  Please advise."}
{"label":5,"review":"Bought it as a gift for my wife she loves it. People from her work are jealous. The shirt fits and looks great."}
{"label":2,"review":"I bought this for my wife, she uses Medium to large, according to the reviews, we decided to buy it Medium, but it seems like an extra large."}
{"label":5,"review":"This dress is a win win. I am wearing it to my sister's wedding as her maid of honor and it looks excellent.<br \/><br \/>Let me preface by saying that this dress is what it is. It is not a million dollar hand made custom gown. If you expect a perfect fit and perfect everything then ordering a $50 dress online is not your thing. However, if you are ok with having to do minor alterations (which is what is expected from any dress ordered online) then this is a great fit.<br \/><br \/>I am a short ( 5 foot 2) gal with curves so it is hard to find a gown that fits my bust and my waist that also fits my height. As such, I am 100% ok with getting minor alterations done. Also by buying such an affordable dress I am able to afford getting alterations.<br \/><br \/>This dress arrived today, 2 days after i ordered it (bought it from a Amazon Prime seller for a few more dollars) and I now have plenty of time to alter it as needed. The alterations that will need to be done are super minor. I will be hemming it and taking it in about a quarter of an inch on either side of the bust.<br \/><br \/>I measured myself, using the measuring chart and ordered a size 12. I usually wear a size 6 or 8 but according to the chart I ordered a 12. May i recommend you not get stuck on the &#34;sizes&#34; but rather order according to the chart. I know it can be weird to be one size usually and order a totally different size, but you can always hem things or take dresses in a bit. You cant exactly add in more fabric.<br \/><br \/>I ordered my dress size based on the waist measurement. When the waist fits, one can always hem or take in at the top.<br \/><br \/>this dress looks really elegant and fits pretty well. Some people have complained about where the built in bra hits. It is not too high in my opinion, but I did not want a gown that had too much cleavage going on.<br \/><br \/>Overall I am very happy with this dress and dont see any problem with having to get it hemmed. Overall I am really glad I took the risk, ordered a dress online and saved a bunch of money. even with the price of alterations, I am saving so much more than if I had purchased a dress from the mall or a store.risk, ordered a dress online and saved a bunch of money. even with the price of alterations, I am saving so much more than if I had purchased a dress from the mall or a store."}
{"label":2,"review":"I received this sweater as a gift and didn't want to insult the person who gave it to me by asking to have it returned but the sleeves are really weird.  While they are not a raglan style, they fit like a ragland sleeve.  The shoulder seam falls down onto my arm, not up on my shoulder as it should and there is a lot of extra material in the underarm area like a ragland would have--it does not fit snugly under the arm as it should. do not recommend."}

I decided that they (as another reviewer pointed out) are not worth the return postage. They had a very strong chemical odor even after I washed them. In fact the whole load of clothes had to be rewashed and the clothes still retain the bad odor from the tights. This was $10 down the drain. Don't be fooled."}
{"label":5,"review":"Better quality than I was expecting"}

{"label":2,"review":"I bought these shoes to wear to work. I thought they were super cute, but I worked one day in them and instantly had to retire them. Maybe I didn't give them enough of a chance, but I found the ankle strap to be very constricting and made it difficult to walk up and down several flights of stairs without wanting to cry... :("}

{"label":5,"review":"So happy with this purchase. I liked this one over one of the others they had because of the pockets in the arm. Thats a really cute touch. This light weight jacket is well made, very warm (we went for a walk on Christmas night and I wore it and wasn't cold a bit) and fits true to regular U.S. sizing. Theres the double button portion up top, a couple buttons on the inside and buttons on the bottom. The only thing I wish this coat had was a zipper inside so I could zip it up and choose whether or not to button certain portions. I am going to reinforce the buttons on the front, just because they feel a tad loose and Id rather not lose one. Shipping was super fast. Great find, great purchase."}

{"label":3,"review":"If you buy it, know that everything looks okay, but the velcro is not the strong kind plus there are only 4 dimes of it down the back, spaced 5 in apart so make sure you pin down cuz it will fall off. I love t because it was easy to see strong black velcro down the back and it works perfect now. Very easy. You would have no problem, just one straight line of thread then done."}
{"label":4,"review":"I'm 5'2 and 115lb, I ordered a size up (Medium) from my normal size and I'm glad I did. These suits run small because they are in Asia sizes.

{"label":1,"review":"The description said this hat is made of twill. It is made of polyester or nylon or a combination of both. It is definitely not twill. Since it was a gift for my grandson I guessed on the size. I wish I would have bought a size bigger.

{"label":5,"review":"It fits perfect. i usually wear a US medium, and that is what I purchased. It fits amazingly. It is a tad shorter than I am accustomed to. However, it is not too short. Once on, it looks like a very nice yachting shirt."}

I sent them her measurements and it was altered to fit her perfectly. The craftsmanship and quality was comparable to all the dresses we tried at the local bridal Shops and it was a third of the cost. It arrived ahead of the estimated shipping date and the seller even kept me updated on the status. We will definitely be purchasing from this seller again."}

{"label":5,"review":"I cannot even begin with how amazing this jacket is. I have been looking for a jacket like this for about 2 years, and I was beginning to just give up when I came across this. I just have to have it, for the design and quality a store could and would probably sell it for about $50-$80 and I would still buy it. For warmth it probably isn't what you should look for, but I usually just wear a sweater or thick cardigan underneath and your warm and toasty. When it arrived it was quite straight ironed out and didn't really look attractive but after a few uses it became quite less uniform\/uptight and more stylish. The quality is amazing, most asian sellers are very sloppy with their products you could see mistakes in sewing and design flaws that don't match the picture. This jacket from what I have noticed had NO design flaws extremely well put together. The hood is detachable  and the pockets are held in place by buttons that are hidden by the fabric, and the sleeves can be rolled up and held by buttons. Beware of sizing because Asian sizing is quite small."}

I liked the multiple sized bands too, it was always a perfect fit!"}

{"label":4,"review":"I'm 5' 7&#34; and 145 lbs and 36A or 34B. I ordered this suit in three sizes to make sure I got the right fit. The US 10 fit very well - it covers my post-baby belly and the chest area was nice looking and comfortable. If your have a shorter torso an 8 might be better. I preferred the extra room since I actually plan on swimming\/snorkeling in this suit.<br \/><br \/>It seems a bit pricey for a bathing suit, but I like the boyshort bottoms and the runched fabric in the middle to cover up the 15 pounds I should have lost before my trip. It's definitely cute and flattering."}
{"label":1,"review":"As others are saying, the \\\\\"wool\\\\\" feels exactly like felt and looks like it too. It's not the most atrocious piece of clothing I've ever bought, but regardless you can get a much better peacoat if you're willing to just invest a bit more. I got a Guess peacoat which walks circles around this. There are plenty of other nice brands to buy, don't settle for looking not as good just to save a buck."}
{"label":4,"review":"I am wearing this compression garment right now actually - I am really impressed with it and would recommend to anyone who is going to have liposuction. I would suggest though going with a larger size. I am a size 6\/8 but the large was the better option. The medium actually put too much pressure on my stomach. Definitely recommend though."}

{"label":5,"review":"well"}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice quality fabric, fast shipping but a little large for my smaller top. Need more of a cup for shape instead of just fabric. Plus the v in front was to long for my short waist. I'm 5'1 120lbs 32B. They let me send it back free shipping and replaced with other one."}
{"label":3,"review":"Colors on shirt are vivid and beautiful.<br \/>Was disappointed that the Large was too snug girl me ,<br \/>As normally a large is perfect fitting"}
{"label":3,"review":"Overall the shirt is unique and of a good quality for the price. However the wrong picture is posted online the actual shirt has a faded Wonder Woman logo on it, it didn't bother me much but it is definitely different. Also it wouldn't hurt to buy one size larger than usual."}
{"label":4,"review":"I would have given this five stars except for the length. I'm five feet nothing and the pants are a good two inches too long. That said, the pants material is wonderful, soft and smooth. The flat waistband and drawstring is perfect for us older ones who have a little extra pounds around the midsection. Great buy if you're taller."}

{"label":5,"review":"I was conflicted on what size to order.  I'm 5'6&#34;, 140lbs, 36A.  I can wear a XS (tight fit) or a S (still fitted but roomier) in the classic V-Neck workwear top (#4700).  Based on that, the reviews and the size chart I ordered a S.  It was too small, I could get it on but it was way to fitted to wear a long sleeve shirt underneath and have room for things in my pockets.  I exchanged it for a M and that fits much better.  It still looks fitted but I can move around, wear a shirt underneath and have plenty of room in my pockets.  The seams and shape give it a more feminine look, the length is slightly longer and the pockets are deeper than the traditional Cherokee v-neck.  The fabric isn't super soft like the Grey's Anatomy line but it is softer and has more stretch than Cherokee Workwear.  I will definitely be buying more of these and I'll probably give the Core Stretch pants a try."}

The tare is slight but bad enough that I won't wear it unless I am working out otherwise I would wear it everywhere."}
{"label":5,"review":"These undies are both cute and comfy for my son. He has a bladder condition that causes him to produce a lot of urine and when he has small accidents the extra layer of protection helps to keep his pants dry.

My son tried these size 7 pants on (he's almost 6) and they also fit really well. A bit long but you would never notice. I reccomended buying a size up in appaman apparel. It fits to the T sizes and you will love them so much you will wish they fit longer."}
{"label":5,"review":"I purchased this and another sweatshirt for a 10 y\/o, that happens to be pretty darn picky.  It was a hit and she wears it all of the time.  She likes that it zips, because pull over sweatshirts mess up her hair.  She hadn't heard of Roxy before, though I had, and is just thrilled with the design and color.  It fit her well, she wears a sz 10 in pants, and the large is big enough to go over shirts etc."}

{"label":2,"review":"The shirt is VERY thin and although this is a slim fit, I purchased based on the sizing chart and it is still too small."}
{"label":4,"review":"I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because it is darker and less vibrant than the picture suggests.  The backing is heavy and it seems well made.  It is still pretty and it's value to me is in it's unique design."}
{"label":5,"review":"Love the pajama set. Warm and snugly. Fits my toddler great. He loves wearing it. Especially loves the cars and trucks."}
{"label":4,"review":"Bought this for my husband. It's a nice, warm jacket definitely runs big as everyone has stated. The only complaint is the hood is very bulky and stiff and makes it a little uncomfortable when he's driving. Hopefully it will lay flat with some more wear."}

{"label":5,"review":"I love the Cheshire Cat costume. It was a hit in our class Alice in Wonderland play. We loved it."}
{"label":3,"review":"these leggings are super cute and super sexy. the only reason why i'm not giving them 5 stars is because I wish they were a little more stretchy. I'm a size 3 in jeans but have thicker upper legs and a booty. I originally ordered these in a size small but returned and got a size medium but the medium was still a little snug on my butt. I'm wondering if I should have got a large now. I can still get a way with the medium but won't be bending over."}
{"label":1,"review":"Cute idea, but so cheap. The shirt has the breast liners over where your chest will hit and these are visible in the shirt. They are not removable, so I can't wear this shirt. Wouldn't purchase again."}
{"label":1,"review":"They need to be better at sizes. Especially one size fits most. Not! The woman in the pictures are probably a size 4 with breast jobs. Very deceiving!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great value.  I have not used the cufflinks or hanky yet, but the tie has received multiple compliments every time have worn it.  Not as high quality as most of my other ties, but then again for the price I was not expecting it to.  Had this been more expensive I would have given maybe 4 stars, but for the price this met or exceeded my expectations, therefore 5 stars."}
{"label":5,"review":"At first I thought these were a size foir adults, when I opened the package.  I tried them on my 5 year old.  She is a size 12 in shoes.  Well, I was sooo wrong.  They fit her perfectly with a little room to grow.  She loves the hearts and all of the colors."}
{"label":4,"review":"I get so many compliments on this dress! I like my maxis floor-length, so I do wish it was just a tad longer, but I am on the taller side of average.<br \/><br \/>My only complaint really is that it's a little clingier through the hips than I expected. The shape isn't really A-line; it comes back in a little through the leg. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it will highlight your shape more than hide it. It's a summery dress and very low cut--I would say lower than the pictures look, and it really isn't possible to wear a bra with it. I wouldn't recommend it to someone large-chested or in need of support.<br \/><br \/>Overall, though, great dress for the price and the print is really stunning. Great for crazy-hot days when you want to wear as little clothing as possible."}
{"label":5,"review":"This tie is very stylish. The material is good, color is true to the pic in Amazon.com. I have no problems to tie it as the material is smooth. When tied it looks perfect. My husband gets many compliments every time he wear this tie (I get many compliments too as my husband's colleagues always tell him that I'm a good wife if I bought such a stylish thing to him (chuckle) - I'm proud of myself :))    The tie fits well to the classic suit as well as to a shirt with knitted vest - of course you should choose the appropriate color of both :)"}

{"label":5,"review":"I ordered an XXL based on the product sizing guide and it fits like a glove (I'm a 36&#34; bust, 29&#34; waist) - I absolutely LOVE it! It arrived fairly quickly. It has 5 bows on it that I simply removed because I thought it was too girly, but other than that, it is the perfect corset."}

{"label":4,"review":"The pants look great, and are very stylish. That said, be careful when purchasing this product, at least for me the 32W version was a little too wide in the legs (compared to similar pants), I'm hoping to be able to shrink this in the wash however... we'll see."}

The only slight caveat, if you could call it that, is that the leather is not pliable, but I think that is to be expected given the price.  Well worth the money."}

{"label":5,"review":"Bought this as a basis to build an &#34;ELSA' style dress for my 4 yr old granddaughter. I removed the flower at the waist and added sequined trim. On the back of the shoulders I attached Velcro strips on each side. I cut two more strips of the same sequined trim I used on the front to make a &#34;cover&#34; over the Velcro strips when the snow flake cape was attached  and machine stitched in place.  I wanted the cape to be able to pull free if it caught on something while she was playing. Compared to the price of the Disney Frozen Elsa costume retailing for over 100.00 this was a steal! The fabric I bought from another site and the dress I purchased matched beautifully. I did buy up several sizes so she could have it to wear for a long time. The length on the size 8 is just a tad too long but with a quick hem it will work great. She was the Queen of her birthday party with all the ELSA accessories. Moms and the little girls LOVED it and she thought I was the best Grandma ever! :) &#60;3"}

Unlike other lined nursing bras I've worn, the cup on this one is easy to fold down and slim enough to provide good coverage without being bulky during nursing."}

I have had PVC outfits that look fabulous compared to this atrocious thing. Shipping took long, AND showed up in a lousy paper envelope that was all ripped apart. I am very displeased.I am too afraid to even move in it for fear of ripping the material as it is too thin and not reinforced as nicely as it should be.

It came with a hang tag that looks somewhat like the ones that come on a Bali bra, but there is nowhere on the product where it says Bali.  I purchased 4 Bali bras just this week and all 4 have the Bali brand on the back under the hooks.  I've never seen a Bali bra that did not have the stamp no matter what style I wore. The description says that it is a product of the Dominican Republic but it says Thailand on the bra.  I'm sending it back. Disappointed."}

However, the elastic on wrists of the fleece layer were uncomfortably snug on him.  He is a slender-to-medium build 10 1\/2 year old whose stong ankles and wrists are showing the growth spurt to come.  We did wonder if a 12\/14 size would have worked for him, but that is not offered.  We were fully satisfied with the \\\\\"bugaboo\\\\\" we purchased for our 7 1\/2 year old grand-daughter."}

{"label":1,"review":"The size charts on both the Texas Shirt Company and Port Authority (its supplier) web sites are clearly misleading and downright incorrect, and you'll be going through the hassle of either returning the item or exchanging it. Order a 3X and they'll send you a 1X and tell you it's the same thing. Then, Texas Shirt Company will refuse to send you the return postage. Their customer service reps are most unhelpful.

I recently purchased them and within a week of purchase I have worn several of these dickeys and I have found them to be a soft and comfortable fit.  I did not find them too snug around my neck.  They fit over my head quite well.  One was just slightly snug but I was still able to get it over my head quite easily.  My head and neck are not small.... probably an average size.  I would buy these again.  I would advise people to follow laundry directions and do not dry them in the dryer.  I let the air dry on a clothes hanger."}

I was also a little nervous about the length on the sides, a little shorter than I was comfortable with (I have a long torso).  But to my surprise I have gotten several compliments on wearing this top with just a basic pair of leggins and calf boots which made me more at ease that it was covering appropriately where it needed to be.  It is very comfortable and flattering to my figure.  I am about 5'10&#34; 155 lbs.  Easy breezey :)"}

It actually would probably be a 5 where comfort is concerned, compared to a more formal, outer, wool garmet, but the sizing in US is a size larger than it states.  Bought this and it fits like a XL, not a L.  But it's great and I can keep a mitzvah everyday in comfort.  And that's what's important, right?  Wonderful buy for someone looking to keep Torah with a modern approach."}

{"label":5,"review":"Needed to use bra strap cushions to help relieve pressure\/speed healing on a rotator cuff tear injury - purchased both these and some of the Flirtzy ones.  Flirtzys were flimsy and got weaker in the course of 1-2 weeks of wear.  These, on the other hand, are made of firmer material (not at all uncomfortable), which is much more supportive and disperses the bra strap pressure effectively.  Have been wearing these everyday (work, gym, downtime) - they are very comfortable and do an excellent job of sharing the load of the bra strap across a very painful shoulder injury (and honestly are just plain comfortable on the uninjured shoulder).  Four weeks in and they are doing wonders for reducing irritation on the injured muscle\/tendon - thank you !!"}

I should have read reviews before buying this set because I would have been warned about the lacking durability. My son wore these pajamas to bed, and the next morning, before they were even washed, they looked washed out and very worn. He still loves them and doesn't seem to mind. I am worried they will not last very long since they are so thin. My son is small for his age, and he is just under 3 1\/2. I bought a size 4T to allow him some growing room - but I doubt they will last long enough. While the pants are plenty long, I agree that the shirt is tighter fitting than I expected. The robe looks cute - it hasn't been worn yet, and I'm guessing it will last a while longer since it is primarily a different material and it won't be worn nearly as often."}

If I were any bigger it would compress me in a way that would cause unsightly bulging. I am bigger from having a baby and carry my weight around my tummy so the type of clothes I can wear (blouses and dresses) don't look fitted to me, even though I'm a size 12 if you took the baby tummy out of it. This belt (and other wide stretch belts) allows me to look more tailored and emphasizes my thinner waist."}

My husband has a lot of different cards, and this has room for all the ones he needs on a daily basis.  This is a good sturdy wallet for daily use.  This was well worth the $25.50 I paid for it."}

Pros:    Screen Protector - Great for those minor scratches.    Leather Case - Looks sexy and protects it from being dropped.    Cons:    Hard to control buttons plus the leather is too thick to shut off my player."}

{"label":2,"review":"The bra looks nothing like what is pictured. Instead of having a plunging neck line that ends right at the cleavage, the top of the bra was a straight line across the top of my chest, mimicking the look of a camisole. I ordered a 44E, so maybe this crazy high neck line only occurs in the larger sizes, but heck, even big girls want normal looking bras. I give it two stars instead of just one because the sizing around the chest was good, so at least that part is accurate. So in essence, if you want a camisole look or coverage up to your neck, this will work. But it you want it to be a bra that you don't have to cover with a turtle neck, then this isn't the best choice."}

{"label":5,"review":"A little over a year ago, I made a life change - instead of accepting a sedentary lifestyle of 20 years as something I was just stuck with, my mid-life crisis prompted me to do something about my weight and health instead of just being frustrated that my desk job has relegated me to obesity.<br \/><br \/>I started walking - first a mile, then two... and punished this blob of mashed potatoes called a body into somewhat better shape. Since I had been sedentary for so long, I couldn't go that far, but as I continued to improve and then had to push myself farther - I'd get all kinds of setbacks. First it was my knees - walking in my neighborhood on the cement streets was killing my knees. Then I went to the park to walk on the grassy walkway to help my knees - and the damp grass would make my feet wet, so I'd get blisters all over. Finally, I got a membership to the park to use their indoor facilities and had to deal with sweaty feet. I hadn't gone long enough for this to be a problem at first - but with my walk\/jog routine now exceeding 4-5 miles every day, I started to get blisters between my toes. It didn't matter if I used powder, used the latest space-age material in moisture-wicking socks, or what-have-you - and a blister puts you out of commission for a week or longer.<br \/><br \/>When searching online for ways to combat this problem, I saw several blogs touting the wonders of this sock. It looked like the oh-so-fabulous kitsch from the 70's... but I never saw one negative comment about them, so I ordered two pair.<br \/><br \/>After a 3-week hiatus from the gym, I hit the treadmill with a vengeance for a 5 mile stint of brisk walking with intermittent jogging. I'm still 50-60lbs overweight, so I'm carrying all that, plus sweating on the treadmill - and NO BLISTERS.<br \/><br \/>The toes in the socks have to be fiddled with for a while when you just put them on. Each sock is clearly for the left or right foot by design. It looks like a foot, even with an area just for your heel.  Because everyone has different toe lengths, Injinji erred on the side of caution by making them long enough for everyone. I was a bit concerned when I put them on that there would be too much material for my little toes, but if you spend some time tugging in just the right areas around the toes, you can get an excellent fit.<br \/><br \/>If you really slam your feet when you walk\/run like I do, you will notice a very unfamiliar feeling between your toes. If you've ever worn the type of sandals that have the plastic 'thong' between the big and second toe - now picture that feeling between all of your toes. Just like sandals, however, you get used to it... and more importantly, no blisters between my toes.  After nearly an hour and a half on the treadmill, when I got home and took off my shoes, my socks were damp, but my feet were dry. The material is good at moisture wicking, but it's that in combination with the material between the toes that prevents those horrible workout-ending blisters.different toe lengths, Injinji erred on the side of caution by making them long enough for everyone.

{"label":1,"review":"The black is of very poor quality, they ripped in the crotch when I first tried them on.  The grey that I purchased on the same order and in the same size is of a much higher quality, you can feel the difference even before you put them on.  I exchanged the black for grey, now I'm happy."}

{"label":5,"review":"Bought this for my husband, we all needed new winter jackets and he's not very picky. He loves it tho. Has a lot of pockets, keeps the cold air out. Ive noticed some reviews said the neck was weird but he doesn't think so. Only complaint I would have is it does collect hair really fast so if you have pets you will want a lent roller or keep it out of reach of them."}

{"label":4,"review":"i think is great exactly what i want,The picture does not begin to show you just how beautiful the shirt is"}
{"label":5,"review":"These are terrific khakis and a great value when Amazon puts them on sale:<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>- soft cotton\/poly blend which feels sueded<br \/>- wrinkle resistant<br \/>- comfort waist band expands with your waist (so you may want to size down)<br \/>- there is a Dockers logo on rear but it is very subtle (same color as the pants)<br \/>- deep front pockets which easily hold large smartphones, wallet, keys, etc<br \/><br \/>I can't really think of any negatives.  Keep in mind, they are relaxed fit, so they do look like &#34;dad pants&#34;.  However, I sit in an office chair for 8 hours a day, so comfort is more important to me than high fashion.  I will look to buy these in other colors also."}
{"label":5,"review":"fits like a charm"}

{"label":1,"review":"While this hat is cute, though marginal quality, I purchased it because I specifically wanted a WHITE polar bear hat (as pictured). The item that arrived was brown.  The label on the packaging did say &#34;Polar Bear&#34;, but I would not consider a brown bear hat to be equivalent to a polar bear hat.  In addition, one of the paws had a long loose string which quickly unraveled, and I had to sew the paw print back on.  The outside fur is soft but sheds easily, and the inside lining is not as soft and a bit scratchy - more like felt.<br \/><br \/>I chose not to return the item since the label said the contents were a polar bear, and how would a packaging drone know how to sort through all the polar-bear-labeled hats to find one that actually looked like a white polar bear?  Also, this was a gift and time was too short to return\/exchange and hope the replacement was really a polar bear.  Poor form.  Very frustrating."}
{"label":4,"review":"My husband absolutely loved it on me and I love the way it fit."}

{"label":5,"review":"5'11 & 135. Small fits well. Super comfortable. If you've been wearing boxers, know that you will not air out as easily. Take care if hygiene and consider baby powder."}

{"label":5,"review":"Very cute costume! The fit was true to size."}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice, but the bottom of the legs were wider than I wanted."}
{"label":4,"review":"Very nice pattern suitable as a cover-up or for decorating. Fabric is thinner than I had hoped and is not suitable for using as a wear alone garmet, child carrier, or impromptu backpack."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love it. True to size. But then again. My baby girl is 9 months and wears 12 to 18 months clothing.  She will be using it for next yr. Love it beautiful color just like pic."}
{"label":1,"review":"I am sorry I wasted my money.  Loved the color selections of the product.  Apparently their was a flaw in the fabric before I even put them on because I won't even have the chance to wear them due to the run in the material."}
{"label":5,"review":"Not too much one can say about a work shirt, but this one is good quality, fits well and is easy to maintain."}
{"label":2,"review":"I received this thinking a small lunchable would fit in it for my daughter to take to the park with her daycare class and it does not expand well or have enough room to really put anything in it. I was able to fit a few ITWorks wraps in it but that is about it. Was pretty disappointed on the size."}
{"label":4,"review":"like a lot of girls here said, this wasnt designed for plus size ladies in mind! im a size 2 and i got these on but they are really tight at the top\/widest part of my thigh. and they tend to roll up and squeeze the thigh, leaving a red ring. For the price i paid i wont complain. but if ur thicker than a size 2, look for something else."}

I would wear em until they faded out, throw em out, and buy another pair.  Costco used to have them, but switched to a different style.  Typically, I can find em for $19.99 a pair so it was a great deal.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>Cheap<br \/>Look Great<br \/>Feel Great<br \/>No Wrinkles.  Throw in dryer for 5 minutes and hang.<br \/>EXPANDABLE WAISTBAND = BREATHABILITY<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>Doesn't look or feel like Italian Wool<br \/>Haggar started making them with shorter pockets.  Stuff would slide out of my pocket constantly when I would sit down.<br \/><br \/>Much better than Dockers or other cheap khakis out there.  But, I still think you should upgrade to full Italian Wool to be the ultimate professional."}
{"label":3,"review":"I love the suit but it is way too small.  I ordered according to the size chart listed on the site.  I ordered a medium but fits like an Extra Small."}
{"label":5,"review":"The shorts fit perfect and are extremely comfortable to wear around the house. I probably should have ordered another pair."}
{"label":5,"review":"I wanted a novelty tie for the holiday season and this was not too out there. The tie came very fast and is a very good length. I have a big neck and some ties are a little short. The quality is good and pattern really stands out. Looking forward to wearing it over the festive season."}
{"label":5,"review":"Wife loves this shirt."}
{"label":4,"review":"It was a bit snug for the x-large  in the butt and chest, but I followed the tip of another reviewer and got a tear-drop petticoat to go underneath and a bra with blue trim to help cover my boobs more and I got amazing compliments at the party I went to. I was a Steampunk  Dorothy and this dress fit so well with the style."}

{"label":5,"review":"I have wore this wig 3 times to Royals baseball games. The color is really beautiful. The wig keeps its shape, even through all of my jumping and screaming and high-fiving. Fit perfect every time, looks great and stays put on your head!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Not the quality I expected for the price.  Not that I'm nitpicking, but it looks like they used a 64x64 pixel image for the flag and camo templates.<br \/><br \/>They fit fine, and are comfortable, but I don't expect them to hold up to extended abuse."}
{"label":4,"review":"Stunning.  Simple and elegant.  All synthetic fabric (for those who care to know).  Nude-colored bra sewn in.  Great for travel - no wrinkles, can be dressed up or down.  Works well for street-clothes, though the panty-line shows (because it is a low, tight cut around the leg - this is a plus for dance, however)."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great tee-shirt for anyone, but especially great for a Doctor Who fan.  Nice quality and the fit was as expected."}
{"label":5,"review":"With my cup size, I often find it hard to find a bra that is feminine. Usually the bras are thick and plain. I received two different styles and two sizes of bras for a fair and honest review. One was black and the other pink. They were both very feminine and pretty. One was my grand daughters size and it fit her nicely. She said it was very comfortable and secure fitting. I loved how it looked under her t-shirt. Most of the bras teenagers wear these days are bulky and lumpy looking. This bra had great support and also looked natural. I loved that there was a small dainty ornament on the front middle of the bra. The straps easily detach from the back to allow you to cross them if desired. This is a nice features as some dresses show more back than others and you can keep your straps out of sight. Some women cross the straps to help with lift also. The other bra was my size and I loved the fit. It was tight enough to support but not so tight that it became a problem. I didn't even notice the bra throughout the day, which was great because I am usually tugging at my straps. The bra was a perfect combination of support and beauty. I am happy to give them my recommendation."}

I hardly even notice it is there. My boyfriend loves it, too. He says that it is sexy, and beautiful....... I love it. It fits very well. It just conforms to my form.

{"label":5,"review":"My husband looked great in it."}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered this in medium and it fit quite well, slightly loose as it is designed to be, and flattering due to the elastic waist. I'm 5'4&#34;, 130# and hourglass shaped. I love that it has pockets and I like the slight hi-lo hem. The only issue was that the lining, which is cotton jersey, looked wonky after it was washed - not the same shape\/length as the dress hem. However, as the lining is unhemmed, I was able to carefully trim it to be slightly shorter than the dress as it should be. I ordered this specifically to have tie-dyed and it was fantastic for that. It took dye very well and looks beautiful now with a rainbow spiral."}
{"label":5,"review":"These are my new favorite &#34;everyday panties&#34;. Extremely comfortable, flattering, and durable. Great price, too!<br \/><br \/>My only qualm would be that all three packages were of the same style and I would have appreciated different packs.

{"label":4,"review":"I love these!  So cute, easy to get on \/off, stay up & good traction for learning how to walk.  I took 1 star away because of the tightness around the calf they tend to leave little imprints.  It's not a big deal & my baby doesn't seem to be uncomfortable, I just don't like it.  But it may be unavoidable for this kind of a product so I don't know if you can fault them.  All other shoes my baby kicks off but these are the only ones that stay up!<br \/><br \/>Note, in cold weather I put socks on underneath them.  When I don't her feet always feel cold when I take them off.<br \/><br \/>Overall very good product!"}

I would say this coat is not as thick and warm as I thought it would be I will just add a sweatshirt under the jacket.

{"label":2,"review":"I feel the advertising on this item was misleading.  It was advertised as &#34;Elope Thing 1\/2 Adult Tutu Costume, Red, Large\/X-Large&#34;.  Based on the photo, it was implied the costume included the striped gloves and socks, which is what truly completes the costume.  Upon arrival those two essential accessories were not included.  If I knew I was only purchasing a poorly made shirt, fuzzy headband and cheesy tutu I would not have made this purchase.  However, this seller did honor a refund, so regardless of how things were described in their advertisement, they were willing to be courteous.  Ultimately the product was terrible, but seller has integrity."}

Fabris is really nice, seems to be a bit thicker, but whoever in China or where ever sewed this, must have had some sight issues! One side was longer than the other, and the part that goes over your chest was lopsided, as were the straps, because the whole thing was crooked, the cut was WAY OFF, it made the whole garment crooked on my body, even tried turning it around, it was even worse! Save your money, get something a lot nicer instead!"}

Perfect pair of jeans for everything."}

{"label":3,"review":"According to Amazon's rating system, three stars indicates \\\\\"It's ok.\\\\\"  That's a suitable rating for this set.<br \/><br \/>First of all, I purchased this for a  2012 MacBook Air 13\\\\\" (Model A1466) laptop.  You certainly get a large number of pieces in this bundle, so it is a great value for the price.  (Note:  One of the images in the listing shows a MacBook Pro 13\\\\\".  This kit will NOT work on a MacBook Pro.)<br \/><br \/>The pink cover portions for the top and bottom of the laptop case fit well, and give the laptop a pretty pink color.  It feels sturdy enough for normal use.  The bottom panel is fully vented to allow heat to escape, which is definitely beneficial and a must in any case of this type.  It also has feet that lift the laptop a bit higher off of any surface, which makes using it on a bed a more pleasant experience.<br \/><br \/>There are several extra dust covers for ports that the MacBook Air does not need included in this set.  However, they have plenty of covers for the ports it *does* have, including the power connector.  I just tucked the extras away in case I have a use for them on another device later.<br \/><br \/>The big letdown in this set was the keyboard cover.  I will say that I have never used a keyboard cover on a laptop computer before, so perhaps this is how they all are, however it rendered the laptop's keyboard almost unusable for me.  The outer portion of the cover (i.e. the portion that surrounds the keys) is made of a seemingly thicker and definitely firmer material, or a firmer version of the same material, than the portions that cover the actual keys.  When the cover is on, the keys are so close together due to the additional material that it's nearly impossible to touch-type as I normally do.  In addition, pressing a key makes the keyboard cover wrinkle and shift slightly, even after aligning the cover properly to settle between the keys as it should.  To the credit of the keyboard cover, though, it does have the keys labeled properly, and the labels line up perfectly with the markings on the actual keyboard (when you're not typing).<br \/><br \/>I did not use the screen protector that was included in the package, so I can not speak to its quality or benefit.  I'm of the belief that if you use your laptop responsibly, you shouldn't need to put a screen protector on it.  From the look of the screen protector, however, it appeared to be glossy.  I strongly prefer the matte appearance of my MacBook Air's screen, as it prevents glare during use.  If you prefer a glossy screen, perhaps the screen protector would benefit you."}

They are not so small that they cut into you, they just fit weird around the cleavage. For the price, they do the job. I wear them for cardio, boot camp, and yoga.

He wears a lot of larger sizes to make up for the shirts length. I took a chance and got a medium instead of a large and when he tried them on they fit perfect!

{"label":4,"review":"I got this latex waist Cincher (13&#34; long at center front), but since I'm a short torso, I changed for the workout waist Cincher that is a little bit shorter in the front ((10&#34; long at center front) Angie is a great costumer service, she replied to me with my questions and I had NO problem changing this item, It takes a little bit of practice to close it but I learn the trick pretty quick, I love this corset, helps with my posture and I love the way I look with it, the only down side is that when I sit the spiral steels on the front poke my chest and legs, I work on a office and I spend almost the 8hrs straight on my chair, I just wish the front was 1&#34; shorter in that specific spot, see pictures for your reference, I'm 5' tall I got size 36, size chart very accurate"}
{"label":3,"review":"the triangular shape of cover feels more like woman's pantie.  The rest of it is good but not as comfy as the intymen material."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought this shirt because I hate shirts that restrict arm movement but I'm not a fan of skinny strap tank tops. The material is very soft and flows comfortably. It fits somewhat small around the waist for a large but overall it's a great shirt."}

If you have ever shopped at Express, I feel like this is in between the XS and S."}
{"label":5,"review":"All OK"}
{"label":4,"review":"What a bummer that i believed the comments that said this jacket ran really small. So instead of getting my usual size medium for my mom for a present, i got a large, thinking it was going to fit well. Well, i dont know why people are saying this runs big..it doesn't, it appears to run true to size. So sadly i had to return it. But it was a nice jacket for the price."}

I fit a small in everything so I was surprised that these fitted so small.  I had to keep tugging and pulling it down.  I would recommend who ever buys this to buy one size bigger."}

{"label":5,"review":"I got this and didn't expect much since it only had a few stars but I figured it was worth a try.  I have trouble finding tanks long enough to cover up when I wear leggings - this one does so easily!  It's really soft and stretchy and feels good on.  Plus if you are a nursing mom, it works great to wear as a layer, keeping your tummy and back covered.  The straps are super stretchy.  I am going to buy them in many colors now!"}

I bought this when I was going to my brothers bachelor party up in the poconos.. Seemed perfect!  It has since accompanied me to a bunch of weddings and multiple tailgates... It's also plenty big, so no concern there!"}

{"label":4,"review":"These shorts have a very silky feel to the fabric and are good looking!  The size, for this model, seems to be just a little large.  I have 2 other pairs of board shorts, both sz.32, and they fit well-one of them is a rip curl!  I had to return these because I would have lost them in the surf!

{"label":4,"review":"I bought this as a gift for my mom, who normally wears 1X. I think it was more my naive mistake to have ordered her a coat in a 1X, since obviously layers will be worn underneath. Be sure to order one size larger, otherwise, you may have the same problem my mom had: She wasn't able to button her coat fully unless she sucked her stomach in and only did ONE button. Again, that naivety and inexperience shopping for a plus-size woman on my part. Other than the size, the coat is absolutely beautiful and pulls ever so slightly at the waist, providing some tasteful accentuation. The color is true to the image and a perfect, vibrant red for the holidays. I would absolutely recommend buying this coat, if available again."}

{"label":5,"review":"Beautiful!  Excatly what I wanted.  So soft and really nice looking.  I can express my support for my team in style."}

{"label":4,"review":"I'm 6'4&#34; (193CM) and the sleeve length and torso length are almost perfect at 2XL. A touch bit shorter than I'd like, but much closer than I hoped for. My only complaint is that I have a long neck, so the hood doesn't fit well. I'm a bigger guy, so it's a bit tight in the chest and shoulders, but I expected that. A really nice, fairly warm coat. Protects against rain fairly well, too."}

{"label":1,"review":"The picture for these tights makes them appear opaque; in reality, they are sheer and can be seen through. I have contacted the seller twice about returning them, the first time over a week ago, and have still not heard from them. It looks as though I am going to have to file a claim through Amazon. The product itself, if you want tights that are on the sheer side, is perfectly fine. What is not fine, is misrepresenting them as having a thicker fabric."}

{"label":1,"review":"This is the most uncomfortable piece of clothing I have ever purchased. The band that runs across the waist is like a corset - I couldn't breathe! And if that's the case for someone who is barley 5 feet tall and 100 pounds, I would hate to see how tight it is on someone of average size. Do not buy this product unless you want to be cranky and irritable all day!"}

{"label":5,"review":"everything about this jacket is great except for the fact that the hip pockets arent that deep. i cant fit my phone in it. either way it has a plethora of other pockets it will fit in. it looks amazing. you can look good in dress or casual clothes. i highly recommend it"}
{"label":5,"review":"Fits great.  My daughter is between a 7-8 abd this fit nicely.  I suggest wearing a tank top underneath.  My daughter loves it."}
{"label":4,"review":"This outfit is beautiful and organic, but the 6-12 fit more like a 3-6 in my opinion. Also, the cost is a lot for an outfit that will only fit for a little while. The color is beautiful and the bow is adorable. When my sister came over, she commented that the outfit was the cutest one she'd seen my daughter wear. I docked 1 star because of the fit and price."}
{"label":5,"review":"I thought i ordered 2 piece but it wasnt<br \/>still i wore it with other top and it fits amazing!"}
{"label":5,"review":"It works great even when I am with a group of heart rate monitor users. The monitor appears to be accurate and the strap is comfortable."}

{"label":3,"review":"Get a size larger! I usually buy US men medium.  I'm 5'9, 150 lbs,  Large chest and muscular in the arms, will fit well if you're probably 125lbs.  Was pretty much unwearable after the wash, felt like a extremely tight underamour layer. Other than that it seems like a nice henley shirt."}
{"label":4,"review":"Every time I wear this jacket I get so many compliments!  It has a great fit and the colors go with any outfit.  The other mom's of my son's soccer team want one and so do the ladies of my card group.  I am just glad I bought mine first!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I am only giving 3 stars because first it is big for my head even for my husband even though we have regular size of the head<br \/>inside the material is hard like hard plastic and it doesn't feel comfortable on the head.<br \/>I did not really like it.<br \/>But with the prize cant beat it."}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice, detailed but large."}
{"label":3,"review":"Quality seems ok but sleeves and tail are cut short."}
{"label":4,"review":"I use these to sleep in, and they are comfortable.<br \/>They breathe well since they are cotton.<br \/>The waistband doesn't bunch up."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great buckle.  Better than some of the more expensive ones I have,  Good buy and looks sharp."}
{"label":5,"review":"My belly dancing instructor was in awe of this veil. Which says a LOT. This veil is not only beautiful (the pictures are accurate but don't do it justice) but also so supremely light it's like working with air. The suppleness means that when you do twirls or the smoke pattern, the fabric floats in deliciously beautiful ways. I may very well buy more to match my other outfits, but I believe that is color is going to be my favorite. I highly recommend getting these belly dancing veils from Nahari."}

{"label":1,"review":"The plastic film that covers the face of the phone fits too tight. It seemed as though I might tear the stitching to get the phone to slide into position. Also, once in the case, which I never achieved, you would not be able to use the slide function of the phone. This case was not what I was hoping for and I plan to return it."}

{"label":3,"review":"This is a lovely sweater. It's a bit short, but it's not belly-baring.  The issue for me was that I have a large bust and the built-in shrug couldn't adapt, and kept rolling up instead of lying flat. I had to send it back. If you are above a C cup, this probably won't work for you."}
{"label":4,"review":"It came in a timely manor and fits well. The fabric is not what I thought it would be but overall I am satisfied."}

I wear to work-out\/exercise and\/or with a long tunic, sweater, sweatshirt\/hoodie, etc.  They also look great with a little tight stretchy skirt\/miniskirt and boots, sneakers (Converse type) flats\/flip flops.  So far, my favorite leggings.  Form fitting and comfortable.  Just purchased another pair.  I have a couple for working out and then others for wearing out!"}

{"label":5,"review":"I was dubious of this suit considering the price and some of the reviews, but thought I'd take a chance since I didn't want to pay the price for a Triangl suit. I am 5'2, 122 lbs and a 32D and ordered the Medium based on the reviews and the suit fits just about perfect. The bottoms are a teeny teeny tiny bit loose, like they may slip down in rough surf but generally they fit well. Because of the neoprene, there is no give at all and I think a small would be way too tight so I'll live with it. The cups of the top fit perfectly but the band is a little too loose, I can wear it as is, but since I sew I can make some small adjustments and it'll fit perfect. Overall I really love the suit, it's really cute, the color is great and seems like good quality and for the price, it can't be beat. I think I'm going to order another color!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I ordered this coat in both black and red in size X-small.  I normally wear a size 4 and am petite.  The coats are beautiful but fit more like they are size medium.  That said, I am having the coat sleeves hemmed  because there's no way I could get a coat this cheap (24.99!) and this high quality (cashmere blend!) anywhere else.  At the place I took the coats to have them altered, the women were commenting on how beautiful the coats were and especially the rich beautiful color of the red one."}
{"label":5,"review":"Although I expected the flower to be pink and white, rather than tan and white, I love the hat. It is a totally fun accessory and I can wear it with lots of outfits this summer.

{"label":2,"review":"I ordered this in a size 38. The corset fit fine around but was not long enough for me to feel comfortable enough to wear it out. There isn't any support like the item claims and the zipper kept coming undone. I would have returned this but i waited too long."}
{"label":1,"review":"Very poor quality. Made of the same material as a painters cloth tarp. Shrunk on the first wash. I buy all my clothes in size large,but to be cautious I bought extra large. I was just able to put them on. After washing I threw them out."}

{"label":2,"review":"Based on customer review i decided to get a medium since since i mostly fit in 10 US size with a conscious of my 36 DD cup size.<br \/>Believe me i could have fit in a small size perfectly. This dress is so flattering on the model that i wanted it so bad now i'm swimming in a medium size. Will get it tailored."}

{"label":5,"review":"Excellent"}
{"label":4,"review":"Very warm and a nice feeling material."}
{"label":4,"review":"I really like it. It probably should be made a bit better in overall quality...it kinda runs in places like how panty hoses do.  And it needs a tag or print that shows which way it goes on....it takes a second to figure out.<br \/>But still its cool.  It doesn't make me look skinny or anything...I'm not looking for that aspect...but it makes my shirts fit & move more comfortably."}
{"label":5,"review":"This style of shorts is the perfect fit and comfort!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Review by my wife Suzy:<br \/><br \/>This bralette is perfect! I read previous reviews and saw that it typically ran small in size. I checked out the sizing chart and measures myself to be sure. I'm 5'4'' and 135 lbs, normally a size 4-6 or small\/medium. I normally am a 34D so I ordered the 36 band to compensate for the size running small. It fits like a glove!<br \/><br \/>It isn't itchy, the pads are good support. And there is a dangly jewel between the pads. Love it already!"}
{"label":1,"review":"I bought two of these sets for my two boys to wear to a wedding, intending for them to match. I didn't see the &#34;tie color may vary&#34; fine print and the photo for both shirts was exactly the same (no alternate tie color shown for either of them). Alas, they sent me two different ties, OF COURSE, which was very disappointing. SO BEWARE: The photo is misleading, and you may indeed get a red tie, not the blue and green one shown. Grrr."}
{"label":2,"review":"Succinctly put, the three reasons why this wallet is useless to me are: it is uncomfortably large compared to my old Dockers wallet, the card pockets are so tight that it is impossible to remove cards and IDs quickly or easily, and the lowest two card pockets are the same depth so that the card in the bottom pocket will cover up the card in the pocket above it rendering one of the four slots per column useless. There is about a centimeter of leather projecting pointlessly above the top of the wallet. If this wallet had been designed with three larger card slots per column for a total of nine slots I'm sure I would have liked it much better. As it is, my old wallet is far superior and I'm stuck trying to stretch out the card pockets to make the Alpine Swiss a little less useless."}
{"label":5,"review":"Excellent product.  Nice, heavy corduroy and the inside is lined giving the shirt a firm, cozy feeling.  The shirt tails when worn outside the pants do not curl or crease from sitting the way the thinner corduroy do that I have owned in the past.  The button front pockets are far superior to the flap style pockets, which always curl and must be ironed to look neat and crisp.  An excellent value for the price, especially when purchased on sale."}
{"label":5,"review":"Wonderful!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Love my perky lift, when I wear a cocktail dress I love how the perky lift completes me. It gives me the lift I want and I can wear my own bra.  I have the beige one and I love the material and how it feels.  I have used other shape wear and they always climbed up and was always uncomfortable."}
{"label":3,"review":"I would have given this 2 stars, but for the low price.  It does I guess what it is supposed to do - blocks the sun.  It does not look great - sort of droops. The fabric is also very cheap feeling.  I would opt for the speedo ones."}

{"label":2,"review":"I feel like an oddball writing the bad review, but the fabric is so thin that it seems to really accentuate my cellulite. I am a thin and fit woman, I workout a ton and am a size 2 pant size, but these pants have found every ounce of fat on my booty and brought it out for everyone to see. I dont know if it is the color or what but these pants are workout motivation."}
{"label":4,"review":"This dress is true to size and color.  Well made and the texture shows up nicely in person.  Doesn't twirl out that much, if you're looking for a twirly dress, try something else."}
{"label":4,"review":"I received this product in the mail a week ago for my daughter. She is on the smaller size and reading previous reviews I figures it would be to small on her she's 5 months old and wearing 0-3\/3 month cloths so I got size 3-6 months. Her hands fit through the holes just fine and it is actually a little big on her! She will grow into it so it's no big deal, all in all I am pretty happy with my purchase!"}
{"label":1,"review":"If that's the look your going with, then awesome. The silver collar also kept coming and there is so much of the silver that you can't really hid it unless you cut it, so it looks extra trashy."}

{"label":5,"review":"This leather aviator's cap was much better than I expected for the price. We bought in October for a Halloween costume, and the seller didn't raise the prices either, which was nice. A child wore this, but he has a big head. Also, the little buckles at the front and back allowed for customizing the fit. The costume was a great success, and this hat was a huge part of making it look so good. What a great find!"}

{"label":5,"review":"This bra gives good support.It is very pretty, light-to-wear, and has shimmery floral design. The thickness of the lining is just right, preventing nipples from showing through, and giving at the same time a touch of subtle extra \\\\\"padding\\\\\", without being neither too thick nor too hot. The design also gives good breast \\\\\"division\\\\\". Overall, a well made, feminine, attactive, comfortable, and reasonably priced bra. This flesh color does not show under thinner summer tops or dresses, unlike white. Highly recommended!"}

{"label":3,"review":"I liked how comfortable this robe is and immediately ordered another after I tried it on.  Should have waited, because it immediately began to snag, so that there are thousands of little strings hanging out from the fabric.  Don't know how it will wash because I haven't yet worn it enough to get it dirty enough to wash.  But it is cheap and very comfortable.  Can't have everything."}

Pants were a 3T, which isn't a huge deal, since at least she'll grow into them, but still disappointing that the outfit did not arrive entirely in the same size.  Plastic bag that it came in was kinda thrashed, so it had to be re-wrapped as it was a gift."}

The term &#34;shorts&#34; should be use loosely though.  They're barely bigger than a pair of boy short underwear and the material is not very thick - it's not sheer, but I don't feel comfortable wearing these to raves and festivals without a pair of underwear underneath.  But warning:  the green color does NOT glow in the dark.  I'll still be wearing them for my outfit, but I was disappointed and don't know why they show a photo with them glowing in the dark."}

{"label":5,"review":"This dress is so much prettier in person- the bodice is ruffled tiers that flatter any figure.<br \/>I bought this at JC Penney in the juniors dept for my daughter- I was not aware that Amazon carried it.<br \/>I think it is a steal for the price- my daughter is 10 years old, 5 foot three and 110 pounds. Trying to find a pretty dress for<br \/>her is very difficult, as she can easily wear women's sizes, but they are not appropriate for a 10 yr old.<br \/>This dress is very soft and modest, comes with a built in slip and fell below her knees. We bought a size 201\/2, which is a little big for her.<br \/>An 181\/2 (juniors plus size) would also have worked, but she liked the extra roominess of the larger size."}

I am curvy, 38-28-37, 5'7  and it feels a little like it's cutting my circulation off on my thighs, I stretched it a broke it in a little though and it will do :).  It had boob inserts, I cut them out so that the top fits better. The bathing suit is blue-r than pictured. It is lined well.  Overall, for the price, it's a flattering suit.  I wish it was just like a half an inch bigger everywhere.  For someone slightly smaller than me a L would be perfect and the suit a total steal."}

I also did not see that there is a GIANT ruffle going down the left side of the shirt--(we are NOT a ruffle family)! I would never have bought this if I had seen it at a store. I have not yet put it on my daughter; maybe it is cuter on a cute baby. We will see..."}

{"label":4,"review":"The shirt runs big, I am 5'4 145 lbs and the large is too baggy. I like the summer weight material.I have it on at work today and will wear it, returns are too annoying. the sleeve lenght is short, which is nice, but i wear it rolled up. will most likely buy another one if it launders well. hoping no iron  needed."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love this product! I originally got this item to fit into a favorite shirt that looked less than great on me at the time. The first time I put it on it was extremely tight and a little hard to breathe, so expect that initially, but now it's been about a month and it feels completely comfortable. I wasn't expecting to lose weight but I did lose 4 lbs. And the other big plus is that it has completely eliminated my chronic back and hip pain (which i guess was due to bad posture). And if you work out try wearing it while you exercise to help keep a neutral body alignment."}
{"label":5,"review":"cheap basic shirt. Nothing more to say then it seems to be well alright."}

{"label":1,"review":"For $24.99, we expected better.  This item is basically the same inferior quality nylon material as grocery story pantyhose.  The fabric does not stretch evenly and you get blotches of darker and lighter color.  The center seam is thick and coarse.  It also snagged and got a run shortly after putting it on.  Overall it was unimpressive"}
{"label":5,"review":"Love these socks and am stocked that Amazon carries them. I aka 6'6 guy with pretty big calfs and they fit right below the knee and the letters bearly warp. Strongly recommend not putting them in the dryer as they shrink a bit if you do. Just flat dry them and they will dry in a jiffy and won't shrink."}

So good that I order three more pair in different colors...I'm sure I'll be ordering more in the near future. I'm addicted lol"}

{"label":5,"review":"I had a pair of these gloves, or gloves very much like them, for 10 years before I wore through the cashmere lining in all the fingers.  I would still be wearing those gloves, if I had not lost one of them.  These Fratelli Orsini's are the perfect replacement.  Fit is excellent, especially in the pinkies.  The gloves pair well with both suits and overcoats as well as more informal attire like a pea coat."}

{"label":2,"review":"I received the dress today, material is VERY see through and sheer. Size was fine. I'm returning it tomorrow, because it looks very cheap, and it really looks like something you should sleep in and not wear out to a formal occasion. Way too sheer and see through!! So much for going bra less in this dress! Don't waste your time."}
{"label":5,"review":"I used these to fill out a bra for a bridesmaid dress.  They did just the trick.  They are quite large - they bumped me up at least a cup size.  I loved it!  They are very natural looking and fit nicely into my bra, and stayed put.  I was worried I would be warm with the silicon against my skin, but I had no problems with that.  I will be using these again!"}
{"label":3,"review":"I just love the tag line on the cap particularly cause I have a big mutt. :-) My one reservation is that even though the cap fits well, it's brim is unusually long. I compared it to my other baseball caps and confirmed I wasn't imagining things.  Not sure if I just got unlucky and got an anomaly."}

This T-shirt, however, was made of strong cotton.  What can I say?  Biz is a character who some love and some dismiss.  I think any1 who wears some Biz on their chest will garner attention.  Now Biz may need to re-see Townsend's \\\\\"Hollywood Shuffle,\\\\\" but maybe he doesn't rhyme with spoon or loon.  This will extract nostalgia from some.  With \\\\\"cold chillin'\\\\\" in the script and Biz wearing a thick gold chain!?  That has 1980s written all over it.  The shirt barely has three colors, but some should love the bumblebee yellow-and-black.  I have bought Flavor Flav and ODB T-shirts in the past, so why not have some Biz?"}

It's a nice looking cap and the edges are curved down pretty far so make sure you like that sort of thing.  At first I thought it was a bit much but it really helps with blocking the setting sun when it's on your left while driving.<br \/><br \/>The adjustable strap in the back is nice too, so even my fat head has a perfect fit!<br \/><br \/>I usually don't pay more than $5 for a hat...but hey...it's a jeep thing, right?  :)"}
{"label":5,"review":"Pretty dress. The fabrics is a little thin but it is a well-made dress overall. I love the sparkle and the deep wine color. The shoulder design is pretty cool, too. Even though the fabrics is on the thinner side, the design of the dress hides tummy and other body imperfections. I went with a size larger than my usual for this one, since it's junior sizing."}
{"label":5,"review":"Really like the flat, minimal design of this wallet.  It works really well for me because it forces me to limit myself to only my essential pieces of plastic.<br \/><br \/>I really like the money clip, which is probably the thing that's taken me the longest to get used to."}
{"label":5,"review":"Loved these.  Will buy again next winter.  Fit perfectly.  Good quality.  Nice pattern. Not too thick and bulky"}
{"label":3,"review":"I bought this to convert it to a custom painted Mando helmet on the cheap. This helmet has its pros and cons. I think it's best if I list them one by one.<br \/><br \/>PROS<br \/>Material: Fairly thick and heavy vinyl. It has a nice weight to it.<br \/><br \/>Size: Truly 1:1 scale Definitely made for adults.<br \/><br \/>CONS<br \/>Casting. The first one I ordered was warped but the seller sent me another and the casting is decent and straight.<br \/><br \/>Finish: The grey is smooth but NOT mirror finish like the picture. The blues are two slightly different shades on the earpieces vs the cheeks. The cheeks are a muddled blue that shows brush strokes. Very poorly blended. The double stripes and forehead accents are NOT black like the picture. They are painted grey like the crown. There are speckles of paint on parts where they shouldn't be.<br \/><br \/>Reticle\/Antennae: Tips forward on an angle sometimes when you move your head.<br \/><br \/>Visor: Only a few inches in the middle are see through at eye level. The visor is glued on the inside to vinyl that covers your peripheral vision. The visor is only see through down to just below your nose. The rest is black painted vinyl.<br \/><br \/>Fit: There is nothing inside to hold the helmet to your head. It is just unfinished cast vinyl inside. If you turn too fast the helmet just bounces around on your head. It tends to slide around as you move making it hard to see out of the already partially blocked visor.<br \/><br \/>Overall I was a little disappointed in the product for the money. I didn't exactly expect a Masters Replica Jango helmet, but for $80 I expected it to at least have a visor I could see through, a reticle that stays in place until in use, and be competently painted. If I wasn't repainting it anyway I'd be pretty mad. As it is I'm still pretty upset that the quality varies so greatly from one helmet to the next. If you can do the finishing yourself, and you are not on a tight budget, you are better off finding a cosplay manufacturer online and paying the extra $100 for a fiberglass blank. At least then you know it was done right. As it is you can make a decent Mando custom out of this on the cheap with some work. It's up to you if it's worth $80 for what you can make out of it."}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a very solid newsboy cap. Nothing special, but the quality is pretty good for the price. Not as great, material-wise, as many nicer caps, but you get what you pay for. If you crave the look without the heavy price tag, this is a good purchase."}

However, the design of the costume was quite clever for a onesie."}
{"label":5,"review":"The received goods correspond to the description, the size approached. Good price. Fast delivery. With the seller it is happy."}

{"label":1,"review":"I absolutely hate this cami. My fiancee bought it for me, but I spent a lot of time searching for it. I was excited to find a black slightly padded cami with the added bonus of being adjustable and the option of being strapless. I noticed the straps were really thin, but I thought, maybe it could be a good thing because it wouldn't show under tank tops. WRONG. The straps are so thin that they cut into my skin, twist around, and just unfasten on their own all the time. By the time I take everything off and fix it, which is not easy, the other strap comes unfastened. It is beyond annoying. Don't buy it."}

I will have to replace it with my own ribbon but it really is gorgeous. I have a large chest and it flatter my breastfeeding and smaller waist. Good sturdy material so it won't bend like cheap corsets."}
{"label":5,"review":"Loved it - was super cute! Great price - great costume! I'm 5'4&#34; and 125 lbs and got a small and it was great. I wore flat sandals and the dress came just above my feet, which was fine because the side panels dragged the ground a little on the sides so it didn't' look weird. Overall, loved it and will order from this company again."}

{"label":4,"review":"Nice basic overalls, very good quality for the price.  They fit like overralls are supposed to, roomy so you can layer long underwear, etc. in the colder months.  I wear size 6 and got a size small.  They were fine.  They do not fit like a fashion item, this is a work garment.  One annoying detail that I did not notice upon ordering is that this garment has belt loops which is an unnecessary detail to invite snags on one thing or another.  I have worn overalls for over 30  years and have never worn, (nor seen anyone else wear) a belt.  No belt is why you choose overalls versus jeans.  I am a horse owner."}

{"label":2,"review":"The poor review goes more to Amazon's awfully inaccurate description than to the product. The socks are great quality and I'm excited to use them, but Amazon is inaccurate and misleading when it describes these as \\\\\"one size\\\\\". The fact that Amazon only has these in one size does not mean that they ARE one size fits all, as Amazon's description suggests. These clearly indicate on the package that they are size 9-11, but this is not indicated ANYWHERE in the description. What a fail on Amazon's part! If the package clearly indicates that these are for a size 9-11 foot, that information CANNOT be left out of the description. Calling them \\\\\"one size\\\\\" is simply a lie- they are not meant to fit all sizes and they do have a size- its size 9-11 as it says very clearly on the package. This description needs to be updated to reflect the true size.<br \/><br \/>Luckily I have very wide size 7.5 feet so the socks aren't really too big on me. There is a bit of a bubble at the end of the heel, but I wanted these as no-shows to wear with Keds so it shouldn't be problematic for my purposes. However, if my foot were slender and smaller, I would be very disappointed and I wouldn't be able to try them on and return them because I would have to rip open the packaging to try them on. And annoyingly, Amazon doesn't offer this in any other size, or at least it doesn't seem to, but who knows, maybe the next person that orders will get smaller ones from the \\\\\"one size\\\\\" pool.<br \/><br \/>To not write that these are clearly indicated for size 9-11 anywhere in the description, and to write that these are one size is just wrong."}

When laid flat, the chest of size medium is 46. The seller's description of item was correct, and not only that, this feety suit is really well-made. Fabric is soft, design is great, and the detachable feet part is really well made and the whole suit doesn't look cheap at all.

I exchanged it for another, and now after another two weeks of light use, it has a tear at the armpit! I'm downgrading my rating to 2 stars because of the shoddy workmanship.<br \/><br \/>I just got this coat in the mail a couple of days ago. I'm a big fan of Kensie coats, so I thought I'd take a chance on this one despite the lack of reviews.<br \/>It's beautiful and warm, and I'm very very pleased! The pattern and zipper details give it just the right amount of edginess to set you apart from the other peacoats out there, and allows it to be fancy or casual.<br \/>I'm 5'7\\\\\" 150 lbs and the Medium fits just right. The coat is lined, which is a huge plus. The fit is great and it looks slimming rather than bulky like a lot of peacoats tend to do. I'm a bit taller than most women, and the length is perfect. If you have longer arms, this coat might not work for you, as the sleeves are just barely long enough for me.<br \/>The outer material is itchy and has some stray fuzz, hence the 4 stars. But the pattern is still very pretty (and you can wear a scarf to shield your neck, which is the only skin part that makes contact with the wool. There is faux-leather piping throughout. The inner lining is satin. Dry clean only (though you could probably get away with hand-washing in cold water with some woolite).<br \/>Can't wait for some colder weather to take this out on the town!"}

Do i want dinner? I'll go hunt down rabbits, slaughter them, and either eat them raw, (done it, but getting the fur outta my tooth sux), or slow cook them bad boys on the hood of my Isuzu Amigo (sweeet!).  I have tried to observe wolfs in the wild while wearing this shirt, but i always did it in the day.  So maybe my disguise is really confusing to them. i don't know.  However, I do know that this shirt is the coolest thing that I own.  When i feel sad or lonely I use the shirt as a pillow case, and snuggle up with Timber, Snake Eyes, and Gus.  Thats what I named my Wolves. They are like family. buy one now!!!!! its well worth it. Even if it doesn't have lightening bolts on it."}

{"label":2,"review":"Dislike this garment due to the fact that the crotch is too long and it makes me feel awkward every time I wear it"}
{"label":3,"review":"for someone 5'7&#34; it is not real long. About average instead of long."}

{"label":4,"review":"Exactly what l ordered and happy with purchase"}
{"label":5,"review":"Carter's clothes is always great quality and this looks so cute on my little girl! This is a great fall outfit - not too thin but would need another layer if it's too cold. Pants length is good, too, which is important to me because my daughter is a little tall."}
{"label":3,"review":"Will have to  .  Regift it not the right size at all"}
{"label":4,"review":"The hat arrived to my house approximately 2-3 weeks. The packaging consisted of brown paper wrapping the plastic bag which contained the hat, when it arrived the hat was in new condition with a neat USSR pin. I had troubles attatching the pin to the hat so i took a needle to make a small cut so the pin would fit through.     Needless to say the hat is wonderful and I will be wearing it a lot."}
{"label":5,"review":"My wife loves the new flannel shirt."}
{"label":5,"review":"I need really comfy undies since I'm pregnant. These are perfect. Low enough cut so not to annoy me.. But not too small where I look ridiculous .. Lol. They are seriously comfy. Will buy more."}
{"label":5,"review":"We love the fabric and the feel of it would buy this again'"}
{"label":4,"review":"beautiful, wonderful quality - unfortunately very tiny! very! I would definitely recommend if you order a larger size. I ordered for son 5t but I should 6t."}
{"label":5,"review":"everything was correct"}
{"label":5,"review":"I ordered a medium and it fit me perfectly! I'm 5 ft 5 about 160 lbs. It didn't take too long to receive it either. The material is nice, definitely clingy but not too thin.The best part I like about this dress is that it's so unique. I definitely wont see myself anywhere!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Good"}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought this shirt for my 17 yo fan girl, and I didn't really expect much from it other than the nice graphic of Dr. Who, but I have to say this is a very nice quality shirt.  The graphic is very well done and durable - not a flimsy iron-on that will peel after the first wash. The shirt itself is also a thick cotton - not the typical see-through material you might expect from a cheap shirt.  All in all this is a very good bargain. It fits well, washes well, and the graphic is durable besides being huge and very eye-catching.  Highly recommend."}
{"label":1,"review":"Product rolls up which is not suppose to"}
{"label":5,"review":"This beret is well made and holds its shape nicely.  Best of all, it is lightweight and ideal for warm climates.  It's great as a fashion accessory, to keep the harsh sun off your hair, or to cover up bad hair days while looking chic.  I have this hat in 5 different colors.  Well worth the money."}
{"label":2,"review":"Nice seeming tie, not too thin but not very thick. Feels ok. The cut is completely off at the bottom of the tie and not symmetrical. I'm glad it was as cheap as it was and happy I didn't buy more than one. I'll keep it because it looks nice enough, but it'll bother me every time I wear it because I'll notice that it doesn't look right. You get what you pay for."}

{"label":5,"review":"Seriously, these are the coolest socks ever! If I could I would definitely not wear shoes anymore to school.  With the socks, the scarf, the robe, the ... limited edition watch and a good British accent you'll be the perfect Potter fan!  Too bad they didn't come out with HP underpants!<BR>P.S. I was mainly kidding, but buy these socks if you have extra money to throw away and want to show off to kids at school."}

{"label":1,"review":"Beautiful red color but material clings to your skin.  Everything shows - no room for a slip. Medium size was more like an extra small."}

{"label":4,"review":"Color ran for just 2 washes."}
{"label":3,"review":"Nice"}
{"label":4,"review":"I've only used it once, but it seems like it'll last a while. My only complaint is that the clip in the middle feels fragile and cheaply made, but I guess you get what you pay for. It's holding up nicely so far, so I guess we'll see..."}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a beautiful piece and the fabric is comfortable. I did return it however, because I thought it was crotchless, it's no, it is a thong. My favorite part about this piece is the top."}

{"label":3,"review":"The fishnet thighs that come in this set as the BEST I have ever found, and Im kinda a fishnet junkie. The g-string is not comfortable and it fits kinda strange in the back, but the front is cute. The &#34;lace vest&#34; is really a camisole that laces up on the sides. However, I havent been able to make the side lace up in a way that would make them look like the picture, but its still very cute and sexy. The lace on all items is soft and comfortable. My suggestion, buy it but throw out the g-string and use a smile black lace thong instead and know that the lacing on the camisole will take a bit of playing with before it will look like the picture."}
{"label":5,"review":"I guessed and got it right for my 5'2&#34; daughter. The 4's are just perfect. She says she likes them. This is someone who only wears dresses or black leggings."}
{"label":5,"review":"I am very happy with this shirt. Heavy material, but not to heavy. Seems very well made. I turn it inside out to wash and so far it looks new. I would recommend this shirt to everyone."}
{"label":5,"review":"It is light-weight, but long enough to loop around my neck.  I love the color combination; goes with so many of my clothes."}
{"label":4,"review":"VERY COMFORTABLE"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a nice little black dress that works for office or evening. The fabric is pretty standard swimsuit-weight Lycra that drapes well and isn't see-through. It was only available in a Large when I ordered; I'm normally about an 8P, but the stretchy\/clingy nature of the fabric makes it viable for the big end of Medium and the small end of Extra-Large, and I can get away with it.<br \/><br \/>HOWEVER, make no mistake, every curve on your body will show: Bra bulges, panty lines, muffin top, the works. Because of the shirring, my little pot belly gets no smoothing; SPANX are not optional. Still, the look is an absolute classic and will last many seasons (assuming the fabric holds up). At this price, it's worth it."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love these shorts. I was a little nervous about purchasing them at first because the rise is not indicated in the description, and i thought they wouldn't be high enough. the rise is just under 11'' which are hard to find. What I love about these high rise shorts is that they stretch! and are comfortable, and not to short short, im 29 years old, and dont want to look granny but dont want to show off my butt cheeks either. Just perfect!"}
{"label":4,"review":"Although overall, the Petite Classic Fit Straight Leg Jackie O Pant fit okay, the legs were pretty baggy.  I would have liked them to be a snugger fit in the legs than they were.  The waist was true to size and if they had been a half inch shorter then they would have been almost perfect."}
{"label":5,"review":"My husband has worn these socks for years. It is difficult to find wool socks so he is happy to be able to purchase them through Amazon."}
{"label":3,"review":"the product is fine, but not worth the extra price.  I found a similar product from another manufacturer  for much less"}
{"label":5,"review":"cool"}
{"label":1,"review":"Poorly made, you get what you paid for. Print was faded and snagged in several places just trying it on. Good for the beach probably."}
{"label":3,"review":"Buyer beware that this is a single cami, not a 2 pack as stated. Amazon customer service is top notch though, I must say, so if you have any problems with your order, they'll make it right. That being said, this is my favorite cami. It is thick enough to be worn by itself and not be showing the world your unmentionables, and it is long enough to cover your butt with leggings. It fits true to size on me, and I love that it doesn't have a built-in bra. The only weird fit thing is that the straps connect with the shirt maybe a half inch too close to the center on each side, so if you're layering it with another cami, the straps won't overlap. Kind of weird, but if you're wearing something over it, who cares."}
{"label":5,"review":"My husband loves this T-shirt. The shirt itself is good quality. The artwork is terrific and seems to be holding up in the wash quite well. The product description mentioned that the fit runs small so we ordered a size larger and it's perfect. Thanks for including that in the desription, folks, or we wouldn't have been so happy! I'll do business with this company again."}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a beautiful robe, beautiful detailing, feels very feminine, pretty color, washes and dries easily.<br \/>I cannot give it five stars, however, because I purchased three of them, and on all of them, the buttons are hard to fasten and unfasten, and a few buttons fell off and had to be replaced. I had to go and find replacement buttons, because the buttons that fell off have no way of being sewn back on. I have no idea how they are attached in the first place, but it seems like they are stuffed on to a little wad of thread, and can pop off very easily. I now slip the robes over my head instead of unbuttoning them.<br \/>I noticed no odor problems as another reviewer mentioned, and as I said, these robes are really lovely, and I will probably buy more in the future.<br \/>Also, just to note, since I don't think it is mentioned in the description - these robes have one pocket on the right hand side."}
{"label":2,"review":"The hat is really heavy weight material and too big for me, however I do have a small head."}
{"label":5,"review":"This is my favorite hoodie I've ever owned. It's fairly warm without being bulky, super soft, and cute too."}
{"label":5,"review":"My sister and I both bought these bottoms in black and are very happy with them. We are tall, curvy girls and these bottoms have a flattering fit. I bought cute tops from Victoria's Secret to go with these. It's easy to mix and match with the black bottoms."}

{"label":5,"review":"A little big since a medium was the smallest size but still amazing and beautiful and gets a lot of compliments! Will definitely be ordering from them again."}

{"label":4,"review":"Good shorts a bit roomier then I thought adjustable waist band which is a plus. I would recommend these pants"}
{"label":5,"review":"Perfect fit. I love the color and it is very warm! I would recommend purchasing this item. Definitely worth it."}
{"label":4,"review":"It completed my sorceress' look impecably. Its a liitle thinner than expected. But works none theless. I recommend. My son also used for Darth Vader."}
{"label":5,"review":"I could say this is slightly big, but in a shirt of this type I prefer it be larger.  It is extremely comfortable.  The price was right.  I am usually happy with items from FOX.  I would recommend this as a comfort shirt.  I do enjoy the thumb holes.  It will likely get more use when it gets colder."}
{"label":5,"review":"Been using this for over a month now and still looks new."}

{"label":5,"review":"Great sweater. I love the look of this sweater and it is so soft. This sweater does run small so order up and if you want it big on you order 2 sizes up. I read the reviews and ordered it 2 sizes up so it would be big on me and I love it for wearing over leggings."}
{"label":5,"review":"PERFECT! Love, love, love this shirt. It is very slightly see through (you can somewhat mako it the lining of the bra) but it wasn't uncomfortably see-through where you can make out the entire outline of your waistline. Other than that (which I honestly didn't mind and I ted to dress more modestly) the falls just perfectly giving a flattering silhouette. Very pretty shirt. One of my favorites for sure!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Love it...wash it before you wear it"}
{"label":5,"review":"These are very comfortable pants. They wash well, and after months of wearing them they are staying strong. They grey is a nice color to switch it up from black."}
{"label":2,"review":"The hat would not stay up on the headband, but looked okay once I replaced the headband for hair pins.  It is flimsy and cheap looking (it is glued together), very cartoonish.  And the simple bright red feather fell off by the end of the night.  it is also smaller than it appears in the picture."}

After i had ordered it i realized that it is only the lace part and there is no wearing it without buying a slip. I was disappointed because if i had known i woukd have bought a different dress. On the positive side i can mismatch different colors and dress it up or down. I do like it and it is cute."}

{"label":4,"review":"The thread they use to sew the shoulders together is a bit low quality. Mine started to tear after someone tugged on my tank. Also, the color on the shirt comes off a bit easy. You might want to wash it cold"}
{"label":5,"review":"Good hat for hot days.  I found I can tuck my glasses inside above the bill so I don't have to carry a case with me.  I have about a dozen hats and caps to choose from but this is my choice when the temperature goes above 100 degrees."}

{"label":4,"review":"Husband like it's but is really hoping it will shrink in the wash"}
{"label":4,"review":"I have purchased this bra in several colors. The medium starts off snug, but after several washings it loosens up a bit and fits well. It is the most comfortable casual bra pre & post pregnancy that I have found."}
{"label":5,"review":"My boyfriend loves it.  He just used to shove money and credit cards in his pocket.  So I purchased this for him because I was tired of him losing things and not having cards that he needed.  Love the color and he uses it everyday.  Great for the front pocket and will not be bulky and saves your back."}
{"label":5,"review":"This was a perfect fit based on weight and size. Hats have typically not had the same fit and have been too small. This hat however was true to the size stated and age of my son. Washed and dried well!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Just as pictured."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought these gloves to replace some velvet dress gloves I had lost. These are stretch gloves so they offer a good fit and they look lovely with my black dress coat. The only reason I gave them a 4 out of 5 is that my other gloves had \\\\\"thinsulate\\\\\" in them and were a bit warmer, and I miss that. But these were the closest I could find and I am overall very happy with them."}
{"label":4,"review":"For the price, you can't really beat this. The hat itself is very well constructed. As others have mentioned, the snap buckle on the bottom is slightly difficult to open. It's very small and a little bit tight -- made of plastic, like a bike helmet clasp. It hangs a bit low so it doesn't really force the side flaps to wrap your face entirely... unless you have a very long, awkward face. I don't really think this is a huge deal though. If it's so cold that you *would* need it, you're probably going to be wearing a scarf anyway, which would keep the flaps on your face just fine."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this skirt for travel - It rolls up and doesn't take much space in my suitcase.  I can wear it with leggings and boots for casual comfortable travel or with dress shoes and hose for an evening out.The only downside I did not see when buying it is it is Dry Clean Only - not really conducive to travel but I just carry those dry cleaner wipes and try not to get it dirty."}
{"label":3,"review":"The fit around the waist was a little larger then expected, and I'm pretty short 5'1&#34; and the length was a problem for me, way to long, but they work good for pajama pants.  Also the material could be better, everything sticks to them."}
{"label":3,"review":"I tried on a large Woolrich parka in Germany and found it fit a bit better than the medium. I ordered the large parka from the US and when it arrived in Italy I found it was a bit bigger than the one in Germany. US vs European sizing is apparently not the same for Woolrich. Also the fur ruff on the hood is a bit ratty and not very fluffy or luxurious.<br \/>I returned the coat with no troubles and a refund was made."}
{"label":2,"review":"It's shorter than it looks But nice material."}
{"label":5,"review":"good quality for the price."}
{"label":1,"review":"This item was impossible to actually find in a store for my baby to try on. We were doing themed halloween costumes with my 3 children. Peter Pan, Tinkerbell and the baby was to be the crocodile. Unfortunately, it was sized small 6-12 months and was way too big. My 3 year old could have worn this. We only ended up using the head piece for the baby and something else for her costume. Huge bummer though because it was the closest match we could find for Peter Pan look alikes."}
{"label":2,"review":"This item ran quite small.  I was overall disappointed in the quality of a &#34;Disney&#34; product.  I would not buy this again."}
{"label":1,"review":"These Jeans are made with a thin worn out denim material.  They look like they've been washed until the threads show.  Not a true Levi 501 Pre Shrunk. Beware.<br \/>test edit"}

{"label":3,"review":"This is not pebble grain leather, it is fine grain. It is quality leather, but not pebble as I was looking for.<br \/><br \/>It is extremely tight. It barely fit cards in, but over time it should stretch.<br \/><br \/>It is pretty thick. It was acceptably thick until i a few bills in, then it just became absurdly thick for such a thin wallet.<br \/><br \/>for its low price, its a nice wallet if you barely keep anything in it. If you want a thin wallet with lots of stuff in it, look elsewhere."}
{"label":5,"review":"I was worried about the size fit but this dress is my closet jewel! It flatters everything and I didn't need a shaper!"}
{"label":3,"review":"This coat is very pretty and the material is soft and comfortable. However, the puffy squares are not attractive and this is the main reason I returned the coat."}

{"label":5,"review":"This is a great tee.  It fits perfectly and looks new after multiple washes."}
{"label":5,"review":"Dress fit great wore it to my 2nd swinger party"}
{"label":5,"review":"UPDATE-- This item still holds ups overall, however I have found the finish around the edges to fade relatively quick. It has been under a year, and this happened months ago (I have forgotten to update this until now). I still enjoy the wallet but the finish is bothersome.<br \/><br \/>Kenneth Cole is my favourite designer, and I've had another wallet from them. My previous one however while the look was right, size etc, the cards would often shift coming out of the pockets. The liner would leave the design imprint on my cards which is a pain to get off.<br \/><br \/>Now this montrose does not have any of these issues so far. The pockets are very fitted which is an initial struggle to put the cards in but they stay in place. The liner has no designs on it, and does not appear to be imprinting on the cards. In addition to all that, the design is perfect for my needs, two display pockets for ID's, numerous pockets for cards, coin pouch (though I don't use it). Best of all after putting everything in, there isn't a ton of added bulk to it, which is usually the case. So far very satisfied with this order, more so for the price!"}

{"label":2,"review":"I searched high and low for a warrior woman costume for a Renaissance Fair I'm attending and finally found this one. After doing some research for this product online, I purchased it. It came in today and I tried it on immediately, and was pretty disappointed. Perhaps this costume is only made for women with super-model curves, but it fits horribly. The bodice looks form-fitting, but it's not flattering at all. The back is a sheer brown material (not imitation leather like the front) and the two halves are stitched together poorly; I'd be afraid to wear this long than an hour or so for fear of it ripping apart. Also, the top of the bodice, which looks like it would wrap around the neck, is really just two pieces with awkwardly-placed loops at the end. Perhaps the wearer is supposed to tie it together herself, but I tried and it was extremely cumbersome; it caused the straps to bunch awkwardly. The skirt is sheer and nearly see-through, and I feel like someone stepping on it would cause the entire thing to fall to pieces.<br \/><br \/>I gave this costume two stars because a) it looks good in the picture, and b) perhaps it looks good on a more petite woman. On my 6-foot frame, however, it isn't flattering at all. I feel like I could make the exact costume out of better materials for a lower cost. Not worth the cash, in my opinion."}

Called them on the phone and left repeated voicemails asking them to cancel the order and call me back to confirm. They never did. I refused the shipment when it came (so I have no idea what the dress really looks like), and emailed them that I wanted a full refund, including shipping. They don't want to refund the shipping, and they claim they never got my voicemails. That's a flat-out lie, since my mother and I both left one.     They get two stars for at least responding to my email. I don't know if I'll bother fighting over the shipping at all, even though it's $22. I do know that I'll never buy anything from them again."}

{"label":2,"review":"Instead of the usual shoulder seams, there are seams on the arms where the edge of a t-shirt sleeve would normally be.  You cannot see this in the picture because of the way the model is wearing it.<br \/>I was hoping this could be worn like your usual cowl neck (draped), as a hoodie (as advertised) & over the shoulder (as pictured.)  If you don't wear it over the shoulders as shown, it looks weird.  I returned it."}

Tried it on before washing it and I noticed that mine was a little too tight in the sleeves, so the perfect solution for me was to cut off the sleeves off. Personally I like the look of the shirt better with out the sleeves. With sleeves I would give this shirt a 4 start but after making it sleeveless it deserves 5 stars."}

{"label":4,"review":"Love how this bra fits and holds my girls up. The closure on the back is different from what I'm used too, so its going to take a bit to get used too. I am used to the VS ones that have the simple hooks. This one has more of a butterfly type design which makes it more difficult to put on since its a cross back. BUT once on, it fits very well and holds them in place without them being smashed together. I also went a cup size up since DD and E are different with each brand. I ordered an E and I'm glad I did. Band size stayed the same for me 36."}

I was afraid the large would be a bit too big on him since he's tall but lithe (5'11&#34; 165lbs about? ) To my surprise it fit him well and he loves the way the cotton feels. He wants to wear it all the time. The t-shirt itself was Hanes brand which pleased me. Shipped on time , great gift. :)"}

I ordered for Christmas so sadly I can not return since my time has expired according to amazons return policy so another lesson to think of when ordering as a future gift. We are very sad that these did not work because other than the poor sizing..they are very nice looking briefs and my grandson did like them."}

His B'day is next week and he will love it -with the case I am putting in it.  Great gift idea also for gift cards."}

{"label":3,"review":"This is a very stylish jacket. But it's a little short (I'm 5'9&#34;). I ordered up a size to medium hoping for a little extra length and the fit is a little loose and a little boxy, but it's still the most stylish sweat jacket that I own."}

If they included Sat and Sun it would be even better, but she's thrilled with having them for each preschool day and I'm thrilled with her being thrilled!"}

{"label":4,"review":"They're a great size and color, at least for my purposes, and they look fantastic once properly in place.    On the down side, my product did NOT include the wooden mixing stick that it was supposed to have. Moreover, the process of attaching the fangs is very difficult, even when trying to follow the instructions.  It took me 45 minutes to get it right when it should have taken 20 minutes or so.  Also, it says you are to remove the fangs after half an hour so that the once-gooey cast remains on your tooth while the plastic fang comes off (which can also be reattached, they say), but, following their instructions, the cast came off as well.    On the plus side, even though the cast came off with the fang, the fang+cast still continued to fit snugly on my teeth whenever I wanted to put them on during the rest of the evening and even two days later.  You can remove the cast (made out of an epoxy) from the fangs, so I wonder why they don't make them reusable such that you just buy more epoxy.  The fangs themselves are just hard plastic and could last."}
{"label":2,"review":"I was a little disappointed with this to be honest.  It fits good, which was nice.  However, the photo clearly shows it with panties and stockings, and nowhere in the listing does it say they are not included.  When it arrived I was rather disappointed to find out this was the case.  If I'd have known this was the case, I'd have gone elsewhere to purchase this."}

He wore a white tux and this gold vest and bow tie completed his outfit..."}
{"label":2,"review":"The snaps on the side were off center on one of the legs. You could see all of the glue that was used in the snap. The pants are comfortable, but I will only wear them tucked into boots. I wanted to show off the snaps when I purchased this, but that's not possible with the poor quality. I would have sent them back, but the cost of shipping wasn't worth it for the price I paid for the leggings."}
{"label":5,"review":"The shirt is exactly what I expected."}
{"label":5,"review":"Nice jacket. But a little small for me. I am 5'10 190lbs with a 44in chest. For the price its a nice jacket. The fleece is warm."}
{"label":4,"review":"I was glad it felt thicker than expected when it arrived.  It fits well, has gone through a couple washes so far and is not pilling.  I love the pockets, a fun variation.  I bought it in the charcoal color and will most likely buy it in other colors.  Recommended."}
{"label":4,"review":"satisfied with product"}
{"label":3,"review":"Made well but way, too small. It says dress size 4 to 6 and it's more like a 0. The girl in the pic is my size and she must be wearing a medium  or large. It was so small I thought a 10 year old could fit it better."}
{"label":4,"review":"nice quality"}
{"label":5,"review":"I am extremely pleased with this shirt! It's the perfect size, the knit collar, cuffs and waistband is really comfortable, and overall, the print quality is fabulous! This was another shirt I ordered to wear to work, and I got lots of compliments for the colors and the galaxy motif. It also appeared to be made by hand and not factory style, and I was pleased with the softness of the interior stitching."}

{"label":5,"review":"I ordered the lighter version of these denim shirt. I ended up ordering a large, I am 5'2&#34; 160lbs. I am not able to button it in the front, but didn't buy it for that purpose. I wear these types of lightweight denim shirts over dresses or sleeveless shirts for the office environment. It was fitted in the arms, the right length and has a little bit of stretch to it. I plan on ordering the darker wash. Looks great with the cuff rolled up!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Love these good quality Arianne camisoles!  I will always go with this brand, the quality is noticeably good, and for someone who does not like a cotton this is surely the best."}
{"label":5,"review":"Good price, true to size, fit well and seems well made."}
{"label":5,"review":"This skirt fits perfectly, it's long being 5 feet exact, but if you flip the waist up a notch it works out perfect and it stays and does not roll up.  Plus medium fit perfectly."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love these jeans! They are pretty true to size and they do stretch. I have owned these jeans in the past but my last pair did not stretch. I wear size 22 and I am approx 5'8 3\/4&#34; tall and the length does touch the ground. If I wear a shoe with a bit of a heel they are perfect but with tennis shoes they do definitely touch the ground. The waist does gap open in the back but not too bad. I do however have to wear a belt so they don't slide down and drag more on the ground. The weight of the jean is defiantly a lighter weight jean than my Levis but very strong and I would say more comfortable.  I purchased two pair this time and I would definitely purchase another pair in the future. Inseam is approx 32&#34; on my size 22. I hope my review helps someone with their purchase."}
{"label":5,"review":"It was a gift for my husband who has just retired, I loved it so much just take it off to sleep and bathe. Very good quality."}

{"label":5,"review":"This is my favorite Elomi bra that I've purchased. The seams don't show through my shirt, it is very comfortable and has a soft material around the cups that makes it comfortable for full day wear at +12 hours. It's also very pretty. I wear a 34GG and this bra lifts and separates well. Definitely gives me a better figure and shape, which is more slimming overall. The straps are wide enough to be comfortable, but still slim enough to fit under a tank top. Love it! The Elomi Roxy long line bra is also great if you love this bra."}

{"label":3,"review":"They are great, but I am in a program where we have to wear Caribbean colored scrubs, I have a Dickies shirt, so I figured these pants would be perfect. They are a shiny material (my shirt is not) and slightly a different shade of color I guess. And they have lots of pockets that I wasn't expecting. They are nice pants though, I just won't order any other scrubs online."}
{"label":4,"review":"This is super cute!  First time purchasing clothes and even plus size clothes from Amazon,  I'm very pleased.<br \/> I'm a dddd  so that plunge is very deep but that's what I wanted. I went with the 2x and had no trouble with fit along any area."}

I ordered a medium because I happened to already own a couple of pairs of Hue leggings in a similar style.  I would not dream of going any smaller.  They are PERFECT at medium."}
{"label":5,"review":"I've had this hat for several years now.  Being a female biker it is difficult to find semi-feminine stuff, so I was very excited about this.  I'm more of a tomboy, so the black hat with the skull is perfect.  I always get compliments from everyone and have had my sister try to steal the hat on multiple occasions.  The material is very nice and good quality.  Highly recommend."}
{"label":5,"review":"I *love* this wallet!!  It's worth every penny-- it's just the right size to fit in most purses, there are plenty of interior pockets to stay organized, and of course the styling is great.  I bought the one with the heart design, and it's cute and fun without being too childish.  I highly recommend this wallet for anyone who wants to add a little fun and whimsy to their daily routine, but still needs to stay organized."}

{"label":5,"review":"These tights are great! They hold up well through many many many wash\/dry cycles, so far, have not piled- She has been wearing them about once a week for 3 months. Size is spot on, very stretchy so these really will go the distance 9 -  18 months, possibly longer if your babe is on the small side. The bottom of the tights have no-skid  dots on them, so she can cruise around with out slipping, no shoes necessary!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I had been looking for the perfect tinkerbell dress for a long time. I was nervous about ordering online but was very happy with this one. It came in a timley fashion and was not far off from the picture. It does a seem a little shorter than it is in the pic, considering the model seems to be tall. I'm only 5'5 and had to where shorts underneath becuase you could see my bottom if I bent down. The color of green is much more appealing in person, much brighter and flashy! I LOVE the sequins all over, although there isn't a lining, the sequins are basically sewn onto a mesh fabric, it was only slightly irratating where my arms met the outside of the dress when they were down. If you're looking for a dress that's true to the classic Tinkerbell - I highly recommend this one. I had a pair of clear heals, and bought two rabbit tail pom poms from the halloween store and glue gunned them to the tops of the shoes, and the costume was complete. It was very cute and inexpensive considering you don't need much for accesorries - The dress, right shoes, and wings give it away. Overall, I was very happy with the dress. I only gave it a 4, becuase of the lack of lining, and the little sequins I've been cleaning up all around the house for the last week. It does shed sequins, but you could definitley get multiple wears out of it. There's enough sequins all over you don't even notice where they fall from."}
{"label":5,"review":"It's fine especially at price.  I said it fit as expected which it does basically but if anything might be a bit on the large side which it probably a good thing."}
{"label":4,"review":"a good thin rain coat. the hood is a little odd fitting and it can get warm if you are doing anything physical"}
{"label":5,"review":"This scarf is so soft and beautiful.  The picture does not give this scarf justice-the colors are much more vibrant and the material is so ultra soft!  I gave this to my aunt for Christmas-she loved it!  You cannot believe the quality for this price!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Great for yoga, jogging, etc, but buy a size larger then normal. Nice soft material"}
{"label":5,"review":"Cute and very sexy, excellent value."}
{"label":3,"review":"Great jacket, keeps me very warm in upstate NY and even in -40 Montreal it worked to keep out most of the wind and almost all of the cold. The only problem is the hood is very big (on the Medium) and when fully zipped up the wearer roughly resembles, in no particular order: a Dementor from Harry Potter, Kenny from south park or a just someone with the worst peripheral vision possible.<br \/><br \/>I keep the hood down, and for the discounted price it cost ($70) and the otherwise fantastic nature of it it is a recommended jacket."}
{"label":5,"review":"I loved this. I was a little worried about it being one size fits all, but with the little belt, it fit perfectly. I did have to wear shorts under it because I wore it on a windy day."}
{"label":5,"review":"I'd been searching in high-end department stores and men's suit shops for dressy socks for my husband that were of a finer quality cotton and lyrca blend, about calf-length. The combination of this 3 pack is perfect because it contains 3 essential colors, the fabric is a high quality Italian cotton blended with lycra and the length is exactly what I'd been trying to find for my husband. They arrived earlier than expected and the price is really a steal for the quality!"}

{"label":5,"review":"I was looking for swim shorts when I stumbled across these...what a wonderful find! I had never seen anything like these so I wasn't sure how they would be. I agree with the other reviewers about the comfort they provide. My legs are large and I feel very self-conscious, so I usually have tried to find longer swim shorts, which are not attractive, especially when getting out of the ocean or pool and you have to pull on them then they are sticking to you. These skirted capris provide a nice level of coverage and I felt very comfortable wearing them. If you want something modest yet cute and comfortable then try these. They are roomy enough not to feel like pantyhose and are easy to get on. I was afraid they would be very difficult to get on but they were not. The waist is a bit big, but my waist is smaller than my legs.  I tried the medium also but they were too tight in the legs for my liking. I usually wear a size 12 pants."}

{"label":1,"review":"It wouldn't even wrap around my shoulders its so small. I ordered three other vests at the same time, they were true to size, even the asian sizes fit in accordance to their schedule. This vest fit like a extra small. Not anywhere close to being true to size."}
{"label":3,"review":"This is a really gorgeous top, especially or a woman with curves who is a bit more busty.  Looked fantastic with jeans and some brown boots or could be dressed up more for a more formal occasion.  The only problem is that the sequins are INCREDIBLY itchy.  The front sections tended to dip in a little towards the skin, so the sequins were touching bare skin.  Also putting you arms down on top of any sequined section was horribly uncomfortable.  I really couldn't wait to get it off when I got home, but that's the price we pay for fashion!"}

Not only can my wife not keep her hands to herself, I can't either haha!  The feel is smooth, tight (but not too tight), and allows for a nice breeze when the weather is unbearable.  Well done!  GREAT BUY!"}
{"label":4,"review":"I love the material this dress is made of - it's thick, but also very soft, stretchy, and breezy - it feels wonderful to wear both on a cool day (with a cardigan and tights) as well as on very warm days. It wears well and can be dressed up with heels or down with flip flops or a long cardigan. In terms of fit, the small is just a bit loose in general (shoulders, bust, and waist are slightly wide, and length is slightly long) since I'm fairly petite, but because the material somewhat hugs my body, it's still very flattering and classy."}
{"label":5,"review":"Despite a few low ratings, I decided to try this product anyway since it was prime. I have larger calves and thighs so stretch leggings can become sheer when stretched, but these were opaque and not at all see-through! The lace at the bottom is stylish and not cheap-looking as it sometimes can look. The cotton-lycra blend is not quite as soft as an all cotton legging, but it wasn't uncomfortable so it wasn't a problem for me."}
{"label":5,"review":"Its soft and very warm. The scarf is a bit wide for my taste but as long as im warm im good. The hat is like a saggy beanie so it just droops over in the back, very stylish. The mittens were a little big as well but mu hands are on the small side. Still satisfied so good buy."}

{"label":4,"review":"i bought these mainly for sleeping and lounging around the house  with that being said a size medium was much too large even for that purpose. I am a 34 c which i would assume is pretty medium but the band size was much too large and there was loads of extra fabric in the cup. I exchanged them for a small which is a much better fit, the band is perfect but the cups are snug, they do stretch though so its not really an issue. this is very comfortable and the fact that it is snug makes it more supportive because its relatively unstructured. I would say if your lucky enough to be able to fit into one of these sizes its a nice bra for sleeping. if you are larger busted this is likely not the bra youre looking for."}
{"label":5,"review":"Though the product name indicates it (faux), the picture is so good that I have to point out this is not an actual sweater.  Instead, it's more of those light, dry-fit long sleeves.  So, it's a great option for those Texas nights in December that are cool, but not quite cold enough for a full-on sweater (50s-60s).  Great value for the price."}
{"label":5,"review":"I'm totally satisfied with this product. I bought one of these earlier in a different color and use them for a couple of years with complete satisfaction.I have use them as pajama bottoms and also under hiking pants on long hikes when the weather was cold.

The fabric and color were beautiful but I am large on top (42DDD) and even though I bought the dress two sizes too large (I'm a 12 but I purchased a 16 with the intent of having it taken in on the waist), the dress was still too tight on top.<br \/><br \/>It's a lovely dress but was just too small for me on top."}

I'm 6'4&#34; 250 lbs. with a long torso and this thing fits great.<br \/>3. Besides my childhood, I don't recall wearing a sweater.

It looked nothing like the photo (only one loop on each side, like a bow tie).  Also, even though it is described as &#34;small&#34;,  that was even an exaggeration.  It should be described as a mini-MINI bow.  It measures approximately 1&#34; x 1\/4&#34;.  That's right.  1&#34; x 1\/4&#34;.  Perhaps it will look OK on a Barbie doll, but other than that, it's even too small for a baby!  Seriously, I couldn't believe it!!!  It is actually smaller than the hair clip attached to it.  I contacted the seller, and I must say she was very apologetic, and didn't hesitate to issue me a refund."}

She fell in love with its softness and warmth so we had to make the costume face, ears and belly removable so she could continue to wear the onesie around the house all winter! It worked great for her costume and kept her warm and snuggly all winter. We did not have a problem with any of the seams and it holds up nicely in the wash. This was a great purchase."}

However, I took the leap and decided to give it a try. I love it! For the most part. It really does make me appear smaller. The only thing I'm not crazy about is how it bulges up in the back and if you wear it with your clothes, chances are it's very noticeable.. Either way it makes me feel more confident when I wear it so I will continue to wear it!!"}

I went ahead and ordered another pair though, because they're quite comfortable, this time the charcoal in medium.  The charcoal ones almost seem to be made of a thicker, more elastic material. They fit nice and snug and have quickly become my favorite pants.  I checked the tags to see if maybe they were different brands, but they're identical.  I may buy a couple other colors and see what the differences are.<br \/><br \/>Overall though, I do enjoy both pairs.  Very comfortable. Nice and long (I'm 5'7 with fairly long legs).  Not as thin as some other yoga\/lounge pants I've purchased in the same price range."}

{"label":4,"review":"I give the white and brown versions of these socks 5 stars, for the reasons cited in the review below.  I give the black ones only 4 stars, for the simple reason that there's no brand name printed on them, which makes them hard to match up in the wash. Otherwise they're the best.<br \/><br \/>A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with diabetes and began to be concerned about finding hosiery which would not impede blood flow. There aren't many brands of non-binding socks, and every one I tried had two problems- they were so loose that they would shortly wind up around my ankles, and they were so thick that they made my shoes too tight.<br \/><br \/>I saw the Izod socks in a discount store and found them to stay up almost as good as normal socks, and they're thin enough that I can wear them in any of my shoes. The discount store doesn't have any more, so I've been buying them through Amazon. Unfortunately, I have to pay full price, but it's worth it for the difference in quality."}

{"label":4,"review":"Remember, U.S. uses &#34;vanity sizing&#34;meaning manufacturer place a smaller size label or larger sizes due to woman's vanity (Make a size 12 thinks shes size 8 or 6 etc). I am a size 4 in the US but when I went to Thailand, I was a size 8. Vanity sizing is a relatively modern trend. In the 50s there was no such thing as a size 2 or Size 0. Why??? Because the thinnest people (like Audrey Hepburn who weighed 100 pounds) wore a size 4 or 6. Size 10 or 12 was considered a good figure A woman with a 36-24-36 figure (perfect by standard of that day) wore a size 10 or 12. So don't blame the Lindy Bop dressmaker. Blame the US Vanity Sizing for your size inconsistencies. Pamela W. Atlanta, GA"}

The hard shell bottom is great when you're in nature, and there are velco loops on the side that work well for strapping on a tripod bag. All compartments in the bag are well-padded. I love the way the camera sits in it's own suspension system. If I had one wish for this bag, it would be a little wider and a little taller (and a little cheaper). (Ok, so that's actually 3 wishes but you weren't supposed to notice that.)    It turns out that I'm not really toting my laptop around as much as I thought I would. But this will be an excellent carry-on bag for traveling. Eventually I'm going to buy a similar bag, but one that wasn't made for holding a laptop. That way, there is more room for camera gear. But I will still keep this bag for traveling or any other time that I need to bring my laptop with. I love this bag."}

{"label":3,"review":"I like the style and color of this top. It's light weight and soft and is designed not to look like a scrub top. I would love it if it weren't so big! I suppose I am on the petite side as I am 5'5&#34; and 118lbs and wear a size 34 A. Normally Cherokee size small tops work fine but I felt like This top was way too big around the bust area and was not at all flattering. However, this top would look great on women who were more &#34;blessed&#34; than myself."}

{"label":2,"review":"I've only tried one pair so far and I'm ready to throw them away (or give to Goodwill),  They shed in my shoes a little, but the lint on my feet is ridiculous.  The quality feels nice, but I can't take the mess they create."}
{"label":4,"review":"I really like the feel of these leggings. The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is that the elastic around the top started fraying after the first wash. They'll last a while since I wear them under skirts that need a little extra coverage help. I'd buy this product again."}

I have never owned a pair of compression shorts so I have nothing to compare them to however I can say that I think they work great!     My goal wasn't for performance, it was to get rid of annoying chaffing because i have larger thighs. They do a great job at getting rid of chaffing and the also did a good job at not aggravating the current chaffing i had from before i bought them.      The fit is very good! At first however, they would not stay up on my waist for anything and i thought it was the shorts, however it was the fact that i bought them a size to small but that was my intentions because i have been on a weight loss journey.     Shipping was great and these do use amazon prime which is always a plus!    I bought two pairs the first time and I came on here to buy three more. Great price, great product, BUY IT!"}

We have to purchase a push up bra for her breasts to be in the right spot. Also, tho she is 5'8 and wearing heels, the train is a little long and we are going to have to have someone take it up for us as wearing it at prom will have people walking all over it.<br \/><br \/>It's a gorgeous dress.

{"label":3,"review":"I purchased six pairs of the boxers in three colours about a year ago. Proved to be the perfect outfit for around the house, and on occasional runs out to the local coffee shop and grocery store [especially on hot, humid summer nights]. Pockets accommodate my iPhone, billfold wallet and loose change. I wish it had back pockets as well, but alas, nothing is perfect in this world.     Sadly, three days ago I was attempting to take a US-bound flight and was notified by security personnel during my check that I could not wear the underwear any longer as they posed a security risk. I usually travel with the pair on as the pockets provide a safe spot to store important travel documents and cash. Needless to say, having to take my undergarments off in a tiny room under surveillance put a real damper on my vacation.    I am now back to regular underwear while travelling, but will definitely still enjoy these as the perfect solution to the lazy man's lifestyle.    Looking forward to an updated model with back pockets and quite possibly belt loops, and maybe a thicker, warmer winter version. Fur lined would offer maximum style and comfort! The winter here in Canada can be brutal!"}
{"label":2,"review":"This item is described as a swim dress with \\\\\"hip length\\\\\" , however, the dress is very long...about 3\\\\\" above my knees, which is not suitable for swimming....my height is 5'5, which is average...  It is nice enough for a sun dress, but that was not my purpose and the price is too high for a sun dress! I am returning this item.  In addition, even though not a determining factor for my return, sizes are not accurate for the top.  I ordered a size LL (D) even though I normally wear a C, and it is very tight, but it does fit.  I expected a looser fit, which is why I went one size up... I can't speak about the bottom, since I did not open it or try it.... The material is thin, but feels like a bathing suit..and the print is pretty... Overall, not worth the price!"}

The shirt I received said, \\\\\"Sewn in Mexico\\\\\" and \\\\\"100% Cotton.\\\\\" The shirt was substantially different from any others I had bought from a department store.

I seriously had people stop me to ask about them multiple times and my husband named them our sons &#34;fairy boots&#34;. They were durable and washed up well but if i did have one thing that i was slightly disappointed about it would be the sole of the bootie. It is the same material as the rest of the bootie and i feel like if it would have had grippies or some kind of anti slip gip they would have been perfect! If your little one has cubby feet or you just want a comfy bootie to slip on them to go out or just to keep their feet warm inside you will love these!"}

{"label":5,"review":"I think Sprayable is brilliant! How brilliant to have thought of a transdermal delivery of a safe \\\\\"energy boost\\\\\". Transdermal delivery is one of the most effective methods of delivery because it is skips the digestive system and gets absorbed directly into the bloodstream. I also love that Sprayable uses homeopathy to deliver it's lift.<br \/><br \/>The very first day I tried Sprayable we had just had a snow-icestorm with 10 inches of snow covered by a nearly 2 inch layer of solid ice. I sprayed 4 sprays of Sprayable as directed before going outside to dig out of this mess.  After 1 hour my fingers were frozen and I was ready to quit. I went inside to change my wet gloves and decided to continue. Upon resuming, my hands warmed up and I felt this reserve of steady energy flowing. For close to 4 hours with the help of a wooden board, garden hoe and 2 shovels, I pounded, smashed and dug.  I put out heavy physical effort breaking up this ice and moving heavy wet snow, but I did not feel worn out or tired. Pretty amazing!<br \/><br \/>So far Sprayable has not let me down!  I have since noticed using Sprayable my focus is clearer and I can get more done. When I've used Sprayable before working out, the workouts are effortless and I feel stronger. Sprayable delivers steady energy without any speedy or jittery effect.  Sprayable is simply a fabulous product!"}

{"label":5,"review":"I received this last week, as always just a week after ordering it was at my doorstep. This top is really nice! Its cute of course, stretchy and made so you can wear it on or off the shoulder as shown. I also always order a size up or two sizes up in Patty products because of the materials used. In my opinion a top like this should be blousy and not skin tight-so I recommend ordering up at least a size otherwise you will get the TShirt effect.  The top is long(hip length at least) on me and the sleeves are long too. I am only 5'2\\\\\" but I can still see there being ample length for an average sized woman to wear with leggings or jeggings and have your rear covered easily-again-if you upsize because it will cling your rear and be too tight if you don't I suspect . This top will look cute with jeans or dressier options too it really is a highly versatile top!  Overall, I haven't worn it yet (tried on only) but I will be soon and I am happy with my purchase and with the seller as usual. I wish this came in bright blue and crisp white!"}
{"label":2,"review":"I was assuming that there was a way to close the slits when I purchased it but there is not.  Therefore, there are gaping holes in this shirt.  I've tried wearing it with a number of jackets, sweaters, etc. however, my bra tends to pop out for public view."}
{"label":2,"review":"it is not the soft fabric that i expected...the boob cut was too big....im 5'4 96 pounds"}
{"label":5,"review":"These pants are fantastic for hiking and climbing. They're very breathable and seem pretty durable when rubbing between rocks and knees. The only thing to note is they run a bit big, probably due to their stretchy fabric. I usually wear slim-fit style pants with a 32&#34; inseam and these 30 inch inseam pants fit me perfectly."}
{"label":4,"review":"Fits well with plenty of pockets. I only wish that the lower pockets had some kind of closure to keep smaller items from falling out when seated; I will probably be adding a couple velcro pieces or snaps to mine."}
{"label":4,"review":"The reviews are correct that this shirt runs small. My husband is 6' 1&#34; and slender usually wearing a size large in T's but I got an XL and after washing it is perfect. It's also a little thin but you can't beat the design!"}
{"label":1,"review":"First off, these are NOT baggy chef pants. They come in with 36' inseams, which I thought would be fine to just cut off the langth I don't need and have someone hem them. When you do this ( I am a 30' inseam), the leg pocket ends up at about knee level; this making it useless.<br \/>Second the draw string is a cheap nylon cord about the thickness of a shoestring. It won'rt stay tied no matter what you do.<br \/>Third, there is no zipper. I repeat, NO ZIPPER FLY.<br \/>Since I had the leg length altered, I couldn't return them.<br \/>Next time I will read the reviews and pay better attention to the description.<br \/>Unless you are 6' 3 and skinny, do not buy these ants unless you just want to throw away your money"}
{"label":1,"review":"This is a good sleep bra, the material is very thin and stretchy and doesn't hold anything up if you are a large cup size. It is very comfy but barely more support than nothing at all."}
{"label":5,"review":"This tunic fits well and feels great.<br \/><br \/>The fabric moves and lays well, and is very flattering. I wear it often over leggings, and it's just the right length to cover my backside and not look like a dress.<br \/><br \/>It's extremely comfortable, and the fabric doesn't seem to pick up lint\/hair, which is a huge plus for me. I go crazy when I have to pick &#34;stuff&#34; off my clothes!"}

{"label":4,"review":"Based on everyone's reviews, I bought a 3X since I am a 38DD and a pear shape, Way too big, I can take in two and a half fingers on each side of my breast! Huge at the waist. Which is crazy since I wear a 18W. I had wanted a brighter pink but it still was a pretty dress. So I am stumped on what size to get. My daughter's party is in 23 days!"}

{"label":4,"review":"just fine ."}

{"label":3,"review":"This was a gift and the recipient really liked it."}
{"label":2,"review":"Cheap and not invisible."}
{"label":2,"review":"The big picture was supposed to be on the back of shirt with a little emblem on the from.  This is just obnoxious to have on the front of a shirt and looks like you are wearing the shirt backwards."}
{"label":4,"review":"These are the D2 slim and they are true slims, not comfort fit like the D3s. New synthetic summer fabric, Not quite as comfortable as the coir versions, but don't wrinkle like the thicker cottons."}
{"label":5,"review":"True to size love it!!!!!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Really cute and well made, but it's so small it will only fit a newborn, not a 24 month year old as the site says... I am hanging it on a pink fancy hanger as a wall decoration for my granddaughter's nursery."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought this for my brother in law as a Christmas present and he loved it!  Beautiful tie, quality material."}
{"label":5,"review":"A little tight in the crotch, especially when riding my motorcycle. Other than that they fit great."}
{"label":1,"review":"It doesn't stick well. The coverage is minimal and I don't even need that much coverage. I bought one from Target before this one and wanted to try something new.. the adhesive bra from target work SO much better. I recommend that one over this product."}

{"label":5,"review":"Good fit, no problems at all!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Cute. Wanted to write a review because I bought this hoping it would fit my seven year old for her cleopatra Halloween costume and it does. I was worried since it says adult headband, but gave it a try and it does fit her and doesn't slide off. Just wanted to post in case others were looking at this for a child!"}

{"label":5,"review":"Exactly what I expected, thank you. it is quick to put on, hold strong. good material and good fit. Thanks."}
{"label":2,"review":"Fit large, oldish style, not for young woman."}
{"label":5,"review":"My son loves these pants. They totally fit his personality."}
{"label":4,"review":"It's a beautiful dress.  I liked it when I ordered it, I loved it when it arrived earlier than expected.  It was a little big on me especially since the material has some give, so I tried to exchange it for a smaller size.  I was told I had the last one and the manufacture was not providing Amazon with anymore of that dress.  No brainer, I kept it."}
{"label":5,"review":"excellent"}

{"label":4,"review":"I'm putting that it fit as expected becuase I did look at the reviews and saw that everyone was saying it was too small and to up a size. My daighter is 3 she wears a 4T and some times that runs a litttle big (but not on pants).. She's almost 38&#34; not sure how much weight.. I bought the 6x-7 size. From shoulder to the bottom under seam it fit good. The arms were pretty long and ended up having scrunch throughout some spots on arm but it wasn't too bad. The wrist seam was a little tight but also not anything extreme"}
{"label":5,"review":"Loving it"}
{"label":5,"review":"Very good quality"}
{"label":5,"review":"a little bigger but ok"}
{"label":1,"review":"I ordered this dress in red and anxiously awaited it, but was sadly disappointed when I opened the package. I'm about 5 ft 4' and this dress barely reached mid calf. I thought it was supposed to be a full length flowy dress, alas I ended up with a short dress that I now have no idea what to do with."}
{"label":4,"review":"Love this type of pants, although this particular pair is fashioned a bit shorter in the crotch than I care for. In all,  it is a very well done, well made, stylish pair of pants."}
{"label":3,"review":"About what I expected but found a few leftover threads on one of the shirts that I had to trim off before I could wear it. I had just worn a Carhart 3x the day before, and it was just a bit roomier than the Hanes."}

{"label":4,"review":"Received in good condition as described."}
{"label":5,"review":"Very stylish.  They also do their job very well in keeping your hands warm."}
{"label":5,"review":"I wore this shirt once a week for almost a year.  I love it, and the heart buttons.  The material does NOT feel like a costume.<br \/>My heart buttons fell off those, so make sure you reinforce those. :)"}
{"label":3,"review":"Uuuhh, It was a tight fit and the front pouch isn't huge enough to cover my whole junk. I will not ever buy this item again."}
{"label":3,"review":"It is comfortable just not uplifting.  I would sleep in it if needed but otherwise would not really wear it out."}
{"label":5,"review":"Excellent"}
{"label":4,"review":"I purchased this wig for Halloween and it worked well for my costume (I was Leela from futurma).  I hung it in a pony tail and it worked well!"}

{"label":4,"review":"lady of the house loves it"}
{"label":2,"review":"The t-shirt fits nice, HOWEVER, the material is a shade thicker than paper. Poor quality. I won't be caught buying or recommending this jersey from this supplier to anyone!!"}
{"label":1,"review":"It was so see through and thin, I guess you get what you paid for though because it is very cheap. I have to wear a shirt over it at all times because you can see everything if not. I'm only a C cup and it was soooo see through."}
{"label":5,"review":"nice little glove. It fits on the smaller size. They are perfect for my 7 year old but there is no room for growth. He doesn't have a large hand to speak of."}
{"label":5,"review":"Awesome T-shirt. It gave my boyfriend magical sexy powers. Why wouldn't it? It's a RUSH T-shirt!! Dare I put it on? I fear I would become instantly irresistible to all men! That's just not fair to them...like witchcraft!"}
{"label":3,"review":"This is a nice shirt done on the cheap.  The material is thin and shrinks a giid bit after just a few washings.  The artwork is nice but the silk screening is barely adequate.  I brought this shirt because its message ROCKS!  In the land of We The Sheepople the shirt strikes the right note.  I was lucky I read another review that complained about how much this shirt shrinks and I sized up by a factor of two  3 stars for the message and a star off for the so so silk screening and a star off for the huge shrinking problem.  I am happy with my purchase I just wish it had been better quality.<br \/><br \/>You want to see a quality shirt look at any of many tee shirts done by &#34;The Mountain&#34;.  Now that is a quality centric outfit that does awesome FIRST QUALITY shirts."}

I've noticed that people have said that it's quite see through and its itchy. Please let me know if this is true as soon as possible"}
{"label":5,"review":"Perfect for summer, high quality"}
{"label":5,"review":"I really love these bras, well worth the price and so comfortable. The straps on the shoulders don't fall down but stay put which is a big deal to me. I am very happy I found these:)"}
{"label":2,"review":"I like the design but very poor quality, I'm going to spend more and get a better one."}
{"label":3,"review":"These shorts have good fabric and they can even be used as lounge shorts also. I bought<br \/>two of these and both have them had their draw cords broken within one month."}
{"label":4,"review":"My husband was looking for a new casual sweater. This is a great, loose fitting sweater with a fun texture. He loved this for a present!"}
{"label":2,"review":"I really wanted to love this product, but it was a let down. I'm 5'4 110 pounds, size 0-2. It was too long for my torso. The girdle covered my pubic bone and came about just underneath my breasts pinching part of my breasts. It caused me severe back pain after only 1 use. I taught i needed to break it in,  so I gave it another chance and after wearing it for just a few hours, my back started to hurt again.  Might have to return it.  Don't think it's safe. I've worn girdle in the past, but this one is a bit off somewhat."}
{"label":5,"review":"I was really pleased with my purchase of this shirt. It is difficult to find French cuff shirts in my size (or any size) at a reasonable price. I bought this blue version and a white one and the shirt is roomy and the material is comfortable. It runs pretty true to size. The extra collar stays and cuff links are a nice bonus. My weight tends to yo-yo and I cannot afford to pay a lot of money unnecessarily for clothes. When I find a value like this, I want to let others know. I will be ordering another when I finish this review."}
{"label":4,"review":"Fits me loose at the waist (25.5\\\\\") but comfortably snug at the hips (37\\\\\"). I'm a pear shape so that's a common problem.  I'd love to buy more pieces of this skirt in different colours but I cannot remember what size I picked and neither my invoice nor the skirt states the size )="}

{"label":5,"review":"Quality of fabric and construction better than I'd expected, especially at this price."}
{"label":5,"review":"I found these bikinis to be comfortable and my fashion coordinator says they look good. Quality is what it needs to be and attention to detail is evident. The design and construction of the pouch is a good example. I got one of each color.<br \/>I'd recommend these to a friend.<br \/>Am not sure how these will work as swimwear. There may be venues where the white ones are more risqu\u00e9 than is appropriate."}
{"label":5,"review":"We chose this dress for my granddaughter's 4 yr. old pictures.  It is a beautiful dress and the coral and blue color combination is eye-catching.  The bow adds a nice touch."}

{"label":4,"review":"I have a few pairs of true religion jeans & size 24 fits perfectly. These jeans were much smaller than my other 24s."}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a good product. You can organize your keys into 3 different sets. And yes, keys are easily added and removed.  NO MORE broken nails! :-)"}
{"label":4,"review":"This is a bargain- much more than you would expect for the price.  Its cute & sexy, but flimsy (think Fredericks of Hollywood).  Very pretty and at a great price.  One warning (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5): Its cut on the slightly small side, so buy one size up and be forewarned: if you are really a size 'Large', this Large may not fit.  Also- this is not for the VERY busty.  I'd estimate that the underwire cups are size B."}
{"label":4,"review":"This bra offers all the support in the world for a full figured woman. It is  very comfortable as an all day at work bra. The only reason i&#34;m not giving it five stars it that it does give a little pointy look to the boobs but not the cone look so its still  very flattering."}
{"label":5,"review":"I love these shirts! I've ordered 4..in yellow,white,wine and teal. Off the shoulder,on the shoulder,with heals,boots or jeans and tennis shoes this shirt is sexy! Also a little extra plus...if you have a pudgy belly and your afraid to be sexy this shirt is perfect. Conceals everything but makes your boobs look great!"}
{"label":2,"review":"Super thin. Even the XXL is way too small. The dress material was okay, kind of thin, but still nice for fall weather."}
{"label":5,"review":"My son LOVES this. He is tiny for his age and needs thin fit without looking like girls skinny jeans. These are his #1 pants."}
{"label":5,"review":"I bought this shirt for my husband.  It fits perfectly!  I read the reviews as to the shirt being too short.  I guess we humans come in different sizes and shapes.  The pattern is blotchy but I believe that it is the way supposed to be.  Check an enlargment of the picture.  Also check other colors and you will see the same thing."}
{"label":5,"review":"They sent me the nightshirt by mistake but I decided to keep it because it feels so good to wear. The fabric is really soft with a little bit of stretch to it so it moves with your body as it moves. I assume it's the same fabric for the PJ set as the night shirt. It's a nice weight and feels like it will last as while."}
{"label":1,"review":"THEY WHERE NOTHING I EXPECTED ..DIDN'T COME CLOSE TO THE PICTURE... UGLY ..VERY DISSAPOINTED"}
{"label":5,"review":"It does run small, like other said, so I ordered a larger size.  It was perfect.  It's a nice, light summer sweater that's perfect to wear in an office setting.  Hopefully more colors become available because I will definitely order a couple more."}
{"label":5,"review":"This shirt has held up really well. A little smaller than I thought but my brother loves it anyway."}
{"label":4,"review":"good"}
{"label":5,"review":"Just what I wanted to replace the hat I had to work in the yard. It has a large brim to keep the sun off my face, is a bit floppy and has a cord to keep it on your head if the wind blows."}
{"label":4,"review":"Nice fit and fabric...will be perfect to wear with hot weather with the thin fabric...I prefer to fold the waist down because it hits under my ribs otherwise. Perfect for tall ladies. I'm 5'9 and this hits the floor. Can't wait t wear it out this weekend!"}
{"label":5,"review":"fits as expected"}
{"label":5,"review":"Great product. No problems. Is as advertised"}
{"label":5,"review":"Built well and for perfect on my 8 month old 20 lb boy. Looked so cute, it was well worth the money."}

{"label":5,"review":"I bought this for my son for a Christmas present last year. It is one of his favorite shirts. He even said, &#34;Great job, Mom!&#34;  It has stayed nice wash after wash, and it didn't shrink."}
{"label":5,"review":"I always bought 34 A as its the smallest size i can ever find in stores. Im an adult woman!!! I shouldn't have to scour the kids section for a bra that will fit! The price is such a relief too. Simple design, goes with everything. Handles wash and wear without losing shape\/is unpadded."}
{"label":1,"review":"[[VIDEOID:mo2PCH0VIAPGCHQ]]I bought two of these sleeves and in basic home testing, they did not block a reader from reading the information on cards inside them. I created this short video showing the lack of blocking, including a test using simple tin foil around the card for comparison.  UPDATE 9\/28: Thanks to the prompt response from the seller and some research, we have determined that the protection depends on the type of passive RFID card. Though the specific information on the frequency range these sleeves by Stronghold are designed to cover is protected by patent (see comments), they do not work with the lower frequency 125kHz cards, which are used by access cards, animal tracking and product authorization, according to a quick search. So I guess it takes a bit of research to tell if the sleeve will block the kind of card you want to protect or not (I got mine to block access cards, which it doesn't do)."}

{"label":5,"review":"They fit very well! They are thinner than the &#34;escape&#34; kind, but equally of high quality and comfy. Will get more later."}
{"label":5,"review":"Love the quality.  These run a little small.  I'm a 38, so I ordered a 40."}
{"label":3,"review":"Fits to size, iron on seems fairly cheap so not so sure who long it will last, will have to be very careful with washing and drying but overall it does the job. Shipping from the seller was super quick!"}
{"label":4,"review":"The color is good.  The pockets are numerous, including an inside cell-phone pocket with Velcro closure.  The fabric has a nice chamois texture feel.  For me, at 6 feet tall and 165 lb, the Large size is perfect in length and is a little loose around, but OK."}
{"label":4,"review":"Fit as expected I got a size small. I Love how it shows off my hourglass shape.<br \/>Material is flimsy but I highly recommend it. It  plays its role. All costumes are flimsy . Don't get confused when they said headpiece, its just the ribbon with a jewel not the wig haha, as what I was expecting.<br \/>Shipping came in 1 week very happy!! Happy Halloween Everyone !"}

{"label":2,"review":"This item suggested to size up 1 from your normal size. So to be sure I went up 2. While the garment is well made the sizing is wrong for the American woman's body. The garment is made in China."}
{"label":5,"review":"I got these for my husband's Oakleys. They didn't make the sunglasses anymore, but he really liked the fit of these, so replacement lenses were our only option. The Oakley store wanted $60-$90 for replacement lenses. These ones fit perfectly, and were super easy to pop right into the existing frames. Would recommend this seller!"}
{"label":5,"review":"I was looking for a reasonably priced leotard dress for my 2yr old to wear in her beginner dance class and came across this.  My one concern was the sizing because the size chart listed doesn't match the sizes offered in this style.  I looked on Capezio's website and they also did not have a listing that matched so I called them.  The XXS is 2-3, the XS is 3-4 and so on.  I went with the XS because these outfits tend to run small and it fits her perfectly.  Plus, it's super cute!<br \/><br \/>Shipping with Amazon Prime was reliable as always.  I would suggest ordering a size larger based on how the item fits my daughter."}

{"label":5,"review":"Ordered this from a tip from a friend.  The belt is great and shipping was fast.  I mistakenly ordered a size too big, but it was easy to un-attach the buckle, snip off a few inches and re-attach the buckle.  Took all of 3 minutes.  Very satisfied, will order again, and also would highly recommend the product and company."}
{"label":5,"review":"My husband loved this shirt.  The print quality is good too."}
{"label":4,"review":"I bought this jacket for my nephew because he is crazy over pokemon things and he just loves it.The only thing is the jacket is a little to tight .It is made smaller and doesn't fit like clothes from USA so when you buy this item make sure you measure yourself so you can choose the right size to make sure you are getting the size you need and not a size that is to small."}
{"label":4,"review":"Get compliments on it often. As expected it's a little cheap looking (mostly in the hood) but for the price it's pretty good. The purple is very pretty."}

{"label":5,"review":"I bought this in gold for my daughter to wear at a childhood cancer walk.  It is beautiful.  A bit large for a 9-year old, but I pulled the ribbon back and knotted it behind her.<br \/><br \/>It arrived in a small drawstring pouch for storage, and it is already sewn at the bottom so you can just slip it over your head and wear.  The fabric has a nice weight and the rhinestones are lovely.  Very, very pleased!"}
{"label":5,"review":"My hubby is picky about his boxers, but he loves this brand. He wears a size 40 in pants and the XL in these fit perfect. Roomy, comfy, the elastic waist band is covered in fabric and shrinkage from the dryer was minimal. He now owns 11 pair in different colors. What can I say? When I find something the man likes, I make sure I stock up! :)"}

Second Suit, however, recommended a Medium -- and they were right.<br \/><br \/>Note that the fit will be tight, but the effect was great. No loose crotch.<br \/><br \/>By the way, the quality is excellent, including the fabric, the zipper and the printed &#34;bones.&#34; Great purchase."}

The bluer one is pretty, but its not THIS skirt and that is disappointing because this is what I was wanting, and the blacker one, i don't even like the pattern on it, its not even close. So this one is ok, its wearable, but not what I was wanting and the other one I wont even wear."}

{"label":5,"review":"I'm a size 7, but after reading several reviews here, I ordered the Medium\/Large. They fit perfectly, and have been incredibly useful. I have seriously sweaty feet, so I usually wear pants to work and keep my socks on. I've started to wear skirts a lot more since I bought these slip on socks, since they're discreet enough to wear under ballet flats. I wear the black ones with black shoes, and you can see the edges of the socks around the edges of my shoes and where you would normally have some toe cleavage, but it's barely noticeable. As another plus, I've worn these liners around all day and have never had them slip off, so it's not the end of the world if you can see their edges. I've put them through a normal cycle in the washer and air dried them, and they shrunk a little bit, but still not enough to have them slip off my feet. I would definitely buy these again."}

Anyway, being a huge fan of the 50's and 60's look, this dress is perfect for me. The price was reasonable and I expect to purchase more in the near future. Additionally, the color is beautiful for spring."}

{"label":4,"review":"This leather case makes my Zen look a bit clasier compared to the meh silicone case i was using before. I like the fact that the screen protector is part of the case, and its soft so it doesnt scratch ur screen. The flap protects the player when not in use and doubles as a stand when flipped to the back. There's a hole on the flap for headphones, which is convenient. I also like the belt clip. It feels very strong and can be adjusted to ur liking.<br \/><br \/>The bad things I find about this case are: The botton of the player is exposed so you can connect the dongle to dock your Zen, but that doesnt really work as the case wont let it fit well. So I wonder why did they even bother to leave that open. Also, openning the flap each time you want to access the controls might be a lil annoying."}
{"label":3,"review":"Fit is very small in these. I wear a size 3 XL in Jordan shorts, and so far neither the 3 X or 4 X in these has fit. Jogger pants are supposed to be snug tho, so go up at least a size or two from what you're used too when buying these. Quality seems decent for the price as well."}

When I ordered it, I had to rinse it out with water and leave it outside on a covered patio for a few days, hanging, to help with the strong rubber\/paint thinner smell. However, this did not ruin my enjoyment of it. It's fun to wear around, even if it's a little hard to see out of."}

{"label":5,"review":"Just thought I'd let everyone know that despite the item description, this coat is indeed woolen (not cotton... who makes coats out of cotton anyways?)  A few other things of note:  The sizing seems pretty standard, my medium coat fits me quite well. (I may tailor in the waist a little but that's because I'm quite slim.)  This coat will probably be a little lightweight for those intending to use it as an all-winter sort of jacket... I compare the insulation warmth to be comparable to a peacoat. This works well for me as I'm rarely cold during the winter anyhow.  The \\\\\"asymmetrical\\\\\" aspects of the coat that I've noticed are the buttoned flaps on the arms, and oddly enough the size of the front pockets (not the placement of the front pockets, the size). You can't tell that the pockets are differently sized by looking, only the wearer will know that the left-hand pocket is much deeper\/larger than the right.  The lining is a nicely colored shimmery red\/black, with white and blue-striped fabric lining the sleeves.  Overall, I think it's well worth the price."}

{"label":5,"review":"Love love love! Hard to find a bra that will work. I used one of those sticky cup bras that you can get at walmart for under 20. It's a really girly dress loved it! I'm 5' 3&#34; 137 pounds and it went to my knees I bought a medium!"}

{"label":3,"review":"Would fit better if they weren't so low cut. Also a bit long in the legs. A few defects in the front, material worn very thin will probably tear soon."}
{"label":5,"review":"What can I say, was a little skeptical buying suits from the Internet, not only was it excellent value, the suits were of high-quality material and the service was impeccable. I highly recommend purchasing from this company. Please keep up the good work and thank you for all your support and great suits!"}
{"label":5,"review":"Nice quality!  Definitely worth the price.  Bought two different sizes for my sons to wear at their sister's wedding.  They fit perfectly!"}
{"label":3,"review":"Theses are just ok. They fit a lot smaller than size and I did get a larger size but still to small."}
{"label":1,"review":"THE DRAWSTRING BROKE the 2nd day I wore them..  It broke 16&#34; in from the end and well back into the waistband...  The drawstring is sewn into the back of the waistband, making it impossible to fish out the end and pull another drawstring through..  I have replaced broken drawstrings on other garments using 550 paracord, which never breaks...  That is not an option with these scrubs..  Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the reviews for this item..  Quite a few folks have also mentioned that the drawstrings broke quite easily..<br \/><br \/>Also, I wasn't very happy with these scrubs from Dickie from the start..  There are no side pant pockets up where you'd expect to find them on jeans or as found on the Carhartt scrubs, which I do like quite well, although these Dickie scrubs were cut much fuller than the Carhartt scrubs..  Almost too full, in fact.  In that regard, these Dickie scrubs were more comfortable for me.  These Dickie scrubs do have a cargo pocket on the outside of the thigh but only on the right leg, not on the left.  There are also two decent size pockets on the buttocks but putting anything in them makes sitting uncomfortable..  These Dickie scrubs are also cut awfully long in the leg.  I had planned to hem them to a better length but the broken drawstring has saved me from that task..  I suppose I could wear suspenders to hold them up..<br \/><br \/>While the price on these scrubs was quite attractive, I will not be buying any other Dickie scrubs to replace them..  The overall design and material made them borderline for my use in the first place..  The broken drawstring was the icing on the cake..  Maybe I can cut a head hole in the crotch area and wear them upside down as an open midriff long-sleeve shirt..  The world needs another fashion statement like that from an old fart..."}

{"label":1,"review":"I am absolutely disgusted by this product.  Complete waste of money.  These are more like ridiculously cheap pantyhose as opposed to tights."}
{"label":3,"review":"The dress was gorgeous, but it didn't fit. I have hips and because the zipper was on the side you have to put the dress on over the head and I couldn't get it to go down over my hips because the bottom is cut in to give a nice silhouette . However, I did try to step into the dress (from the side) and it fit my lower half- just no way to get the shoulder strap over my head or else it would've fit. If the zipper was on the back, it would've fit.  There was a notice on the dress saying that it was handmade and the sizing may vary. I returned it. It was the last dress available so I couldn't get a different size or I would have. I returned it and went out and a dress by Karen Millen, but I wish this one would've fit."}
{"label":5,"review":"Great product."}
{"label":3,"review":"These are soft and organic which I love but my husband doesn't find them very comfortable. He finds the seem that runs between the legs too far forward.

I had very good luck - I ordered the X-tra large and it fit perfectly.  Also, the color was beautiful - light purple.  Very nice for the Spring\/summer.  It is lined for a little X-tra warmth.  Also, the price was good, too, better than the department stores."}

I had ordered that dress because the material is jersey, it is easy to wear, comfortable and flexible.<br \/><br \/>After communicating with the seller, they realized that they had sent me the wrong dress by mistake and apologized a few times. They credited my account promptly.<br \/><br \/>So for Customer Service I give them 5 stars, but for the item itself, I have to give them a 1 as I was expecting jersey not satin."}

{"label":4,"review":"Although I didn't buy it from here, I'd like to write a review. It is a very nice jacket, I've had it for over a year and still wear it. I'll warn you that if you use it as much as I did, It will get beat down. The black faded slightly, but it's still black. The pocket flaps on the sides stick up after a while. If you're wearing a heavy backpack, be careful; the epaulette tore off the jacket when I pulled the backpack off my shoulder. But I just had it sewn back on. And eventually the zipper broke, and I had to use a paperclip.  BUT! It still remained a stylish looking jacket that keeps you surprisingly warm. Besides I got a few compliments from the girls in my school."}
{"label":4,"review":"Leather is good quality, jacket is heavy and it took a couple weeks to truly break in.  My only issue with it was how snug it was, I got a size 48, which matches my 50'' chest, however, it was too tight to keep the protection in, so I had to take out the pads. Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to go a size higher, as the the length of the sleeves are already pretty long on this one.     Overall, for the price, I don't think there is a better deal, for the thickness of the leather and quality."}

I am only giving it 4 stars because as others have said the to elastic part is a bit short - if you've got big gals like I do (D cup) you may have a cleavage issue, though the beads on the strap do a good job covering the line. Still a great deal (on sale) on a super pretty dress."}

It has 9 card slots and 3 picture\/id windows and 2 slots for cash.  The windows are larger than my ID which means easy access.  All the slots are filled in my wallet and it can fully close.  I should warn you that the card slots are stiff when you first get it so it will require some breaking in.  Also the top card slots out of the 3 in each can slip below where it is visible but I have not had that problem unless I force the card down.  My wallet is less than an inch thick and remains fully closed.  Other than that I have no complaints and it it good for people you have a lot of plastic cards, multiple IDs, and still use cash."}
