{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I have bought that Sexy Bikini Brief By Gary Majdell Sport. That's an interesting version of an American style bikini swimsuit, because I am European I am used to wear smaller coverage :) The fabric has a good feeling with my skin. The colours are bright and I am very satisfied about those. The Medium size fits a bit smaller therefore I have bought the Large size. I depends what you want: a daring bikini or a normal bikini. The price is cheap."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I ordered a 2xl due to all the reviews. I am 5'7&#34; 190lbs. This thing was hard for me to put it on. It took me about 15 mins and I had used muscles that I didn't realize I had and broke out in sweat.I received yesterday and immediately tried on dresses that I've never worn but one day wished to wear. I was in total shock. I was amazed at how good I look. I know I stared at myself for at least an hour.  I wished I would have ordered an xl because with the 2xl it is on the last row of hooks. I expected it to be painful but it is not I feel like I'm sucked in and when I lay down I have a hard time breathing but it is definitely bearable. I could not be any happier than what I am with this product!!!!!!!! I have posted a pic with and without the waist cincher"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fits as expected. I would recommend."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Like many of the posters, I ordered a size down from what I usually wear and it fits the way I want it to fit. The only issue I have - and I should have seen this coming - is that, when worn white side in and red side out, the jersey is more pink than white. But overall I like the cut, which is lots more athletic than the standard jersey with the big arm holes."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I simply love this hat. It is the right size, it looks great on, it is versatile and goes with any outfit, and it is very nice. It has a comfortable fit to it, is sturdy enough to keep it's shape, and it looks very nice. I have gotten lots of compliments on it and I cannot wait to wear it out again. I recommend this hat to any western lovers and cowboys. You'll love it!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I purchased this longline bra for two reasons:<br \/><br \/>1) It appeared to be low enough in the back and between the cups to accommodate my wedding dress; and<br \/><br \/>2) It came with clear straps, which I could use as a little extra support under my wedding dress.<br \/><br \/>Concerning #1, I think it will eventually fit the bill, as it is definitely low in the back and between the cups while still providing support. Because I read that it ran small, I ordered it in a 36 instead of my usual 34. But even the 36 was way too small. I am returning it and now ordering a 40, keeping my fingers crossed.<br \/><br \/>As for #2, I cannot comment because the clear straps weren't shipped with the item. So if the clear straps are important to you, I'd make sure to check that they were shipped with the item as soon as you receive it.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I am exchanging it for a larger size and am hoping that will work. I'll update this post once I receive the larger size. Because of the hassle of having to exchange it, I'm giving it 3 stars for now."}

So much so that it gives me an underarm bulge. A large would have been much better. Trust the reviews and not the size chart and you'll have a very pleasant experience!<br \/>I'm going to keep the medium to wear under sweaters, but it won't work for the summer due to the underarm bulge."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This Jersey looks amazing and the quality is great, especially for this low price compared to if you buy it directly from HBO, ~$35 versus ~$70!! The only thing you have to make sure of is that you check measurements, or at least if you are a big guy, I might look into getting the XXL. I got an XL, I am 6'3&#34; and about 230lbs., I have a bit of a belly but not too much, still an XL jersey fits Just well enough, it is a little bit tight, I am hoping not to be getting Too much bigger muscle-wise as I am working out lately and it really just fits me, arms, chest, and stomach. If you are a big guy too and are looking for something looser, as jerseys are usually meant to be, get the XXL, but really only if you are a big guy, as I went based on measurements of chest, waist, length, and again it is a little bit tight on me. Just a warning. Again otherwise the material is great quality and it looks Awesome! All of my roommates are jealous and regret not getting one yet, I'm the only one who can represent while watching Game of Thrones!!<br \/>Enjoy, Good Luck on Sizing!!"}

Something I have learned with all men's cotton T-shirts though...take them out of the dryer while they are still damp and hang them up. This prevents fading and shrinkage. Seems silly for T-shirts but I don't like having to buy them all the time."}

Is a breeze to change my purse every day if I want to.  Pull it out of one purse and plop in in another and out the door.  Is a nice size and well made.  Had trouble with a couple of the zippers, but just rubbed a little bar of soap over the zipper and it works great."}

I wore one pair and was stepping on them and they got a big hole in them. I was going to throw them out but decided to have the local tailor in the dry cleaners cut above the damage and hem them and make the other pair the same length. Worked out nicely but it cost more to hem them than it cost for the pants themselves. But now I have two good pair. Be wary of the length though."}

I'm actually afraid it will get ruined at his Kindergarten party when the kids wear their costumes.  The good thing is that this mask is incredibly photogenic as I bought it thinking it would be a good thing.  That'll teach me to think."}

Unfortunately, someone who shall not be named put it in the dryer after I told him not to, and it shrunk. The good news is, the lace and buttons survived the transformation, The bad news is it now fits perfectly, instead of super loose like I ordered it. The ruffles still retain their shape, and besides shrinkage, there's no other damage. Overall, not bad. Definitely worth spending money on; just remember not to let it get into the dryer, or it goes way down in size."}

I was having difficulty Amazon-searching until I happened upon these. There were no reviews and I've never heard of the brand 'Noble Mount' but the price of twelve ninety-nine was cheap enough to give them a shot and return them if no good.<br \/>They are not being sent back.<br \/>I bought the Green\/Black checks 2 weeks ago and am back to purchase the Blue\/White plaid (only two options as of this typing). ...And to leave this review.<br \/><br \/>These are perfect summer sleepwear for me. I wear XL so bought that size and they are true to size for pajamas (a little roomy but not enough to go a size down). The bottom hem sits at the middle of my knee when standing straight. The material is nice - feels exactly like fresh cotton bedsheets. Hemming is perfect. Both pockets are fairly sized: if I need to make a late night run my wallet fits all the way in without sticking out.<br \/>If I've got nothing planned for the rest of the evening I like to take a shower and put on my pajamas (these shorts and a tshirt). I've run around in sandals in the backyard with my dogs, squatted to pick weeds out of my outdoor plants (ending up doing it for 40 minutes), among various other activities and not only has the groin not torn\/ripped but I've never felt tension on the hems.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I've worn this style bra most of my life, going from a 32A cup in my adolescence to a 36DD as a senior, needing just about every size in between due to getting older, getting pregnant, gaining weight, losing weight... This bra never lets me down. It's comfortable, even the underwiring, and the best thing for me is that my boobs don't look like two bubbles, which is what the new-style bras do and which, in my opinion, looks dowdy. I don't have '50s points but I don't have round bubbles, either. There's just enough shape to be feminine. These bras wash beautifully, it's easy to adjust the straps, the underwire doesn't cut, the sizes are true, and they last a long time even though I do get lazy and put them in the washer and dryer, something we're not supposed to do (right, ladies?). Since I've been the same size for at least the past 15 years and haven't had to replace a bra for size, the two that I purchased brings the total of the number of bras I've bought in that 15 years to four - yes, they last that long."}

It doesn't show underwear lines either. I have a 33 in. inseam and this skirt was long enough for me. I even accidentally dried it."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Don't bother, I bought an xxl and I ended up giving it to my sister who is a size 2. Not even worth returning bc I only paid like 7$ for the shirt. The item arrived almost a month or more after I ordered it, so long after that I forgot I ordered it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought this just to keep my socks from going rogue in the laundry.  It's a great size for a week's worth of socks.  There's still a bit of room for other delicate items, as well.  Manufacturing appears to be nice and sturdy, and the zipper is pretty good."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Received this order, earlier than expected.  As usual the Flying Crane bent over backwards to accommodate me!  I cannot say enough about what an overall awesome store this is... They truly embody the phrase &#34;excellent customer service&#34;.....wonderful product as well....these jeans fit well, never gape at the back, are durable and well made and they look fantastic....I am a &#34;well preserved 45&#34; and these jeans just look wonderful....definitely a Jean for any generation!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I'm 6'2', 200lbs, athletic build. These pants are awesome. The fit was great. The material feels to be of great quality. And there is minimal maintenance, hang them up after a wear and there ready to be worn again. Great pair of pants."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I actually really liked this dress but had to return it. If you have a &#34;bigger chest&#34; the top of the dress doesn't look as great. Otherwise for the price the quality is great!"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"This was purchased for my daughter, and needed it within two days of an event. I used the measurement chart given, and measured her to make sure it would be close to fitting. The size on the tag was exactly what I ordered, but the skirt was too large and wasn't accurate to the size chart. Will keep until she grows into it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I really like these jeans and I think they are a great  value as well.  For me, they fit true to size, but they do stretch out pretty quickly so its hard to wear them more than once without washing.  Other than that, they are comfy and I've gotten tons of compliments on them.  I am about 5'81\/2 so I got the &#34;long&#34; cut and they are perfect."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great pants. I'm going to order more."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Bigger than I thought. My husband  loves it!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Gift."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Stick was a bit flimsy and top heavy, but I purchased a wooden dowel from the hardware store and it made it more stable and balanced.  I cant complain the Spirit Halloween store wanted 3x the money for something similar and not nearly as cool!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"great"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"It's very bulky, but I assume it'll skrink over time for usage.<br \/><br \/>It feels great, has plenty of room and is very convienant. I'd definately buy it again if it does skrink from use. Especially for the price."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love the assuring secure grip on  hot cooking utensils with an almost total lack of heat felt of the hand and fingers.  Only drawback I encountered was they take a while to dry if they get left in the rain.  Great  tool for both the grill and the stove.  Much appreciated."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I am a small\/medium depending on the brand, but based on reviews stating this item ran very small, I bought a large.  It was definitely too big.  I sent it back & will see how a medium fits. What I was extremely disappointed in was how it was packaged.  It was literally crammed into a small bag- not even folded.  When I took out the crumpled trench, it was a wrinkled mess.  It seemed like it was made of nice material despite what it looked like.  Hopefully the next trench I receive will be better packaged."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"i usually wear an XL but after reading reviews I got a..... 4XL, so hard to say that lol. My measurements are 42.5in, 33.5in, 42.5in. I've got an hour glass shape which this bathing suit, my opinion, is made for. If your curvy and wanting to feel sexy then get this swimsuit! It's a little loose around my waist but not a big deal, it looks amazing! I can't wait to post a pic of me in it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Comfy fit and flexible. Tough material too"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"The pins I received were all so old and seem to be nothing special. Once I go to Disney, I plan on trading every single one of them. I am truly disappointed in the product, but I must applaud their quick turnaround for shipping this out."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My husband loves these jeans. Now doesn't want to wear anythng else to work in. Very durable and fits great..."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I really like this top!  Had to purchase it from amazon.com, since the manufacturer did not have it available on their site any longer. It is very comfortable, and the jersy-like material it's made of is soft.  I like the style too, I did have to play with the tie in the back to make it fit just right.  It is draped in the front and back, and there is a tie in the back at the top.  The sequins look pretty and held up after gentle cycle wash."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"The blazer is way too small. I ended up giving it to my nephew who is 10 years old. The fabric is polyester and should be worn for warm climates. I would prefer if they have an XL size which is not medium in fit. I don't know what else to say, but I do not blame the company for this."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My son is an avid snowboarder. I bought these for him at his request. He loves them and says their the best snowboarding gloves he's ever had."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"fit perfectly"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"This bra was very cute. I would say the 40 band was a little more snug than other 40s, which in my case is great because I need closer to a 38. The cups are spaced too far apart and the wires are not wide enough for me. The back is so cute, but in a 40D- needs to be designed with a little more coverage and support."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Is not red color is orange :-\\"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"So big at the boot area. I cant use it. So big for me. Not the perfect election. Maybe a gift for a friend."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"The touch screen capability lasted most of the first winter after I bought these, but during the second winter the touch screen function was completely lost. They're starting to get black spots where the tan color is wearing away and the grip strips are worn away too. They're not warm enough for sub-freezing temperatures. They're still nice-looking gloves so I will continue to use them as regular gloves, but I will never buy anything from this brand again."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love these!  Fit true to size, comfortable and wash fantastic!  This is my favorite brand ever!!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This is one serious belt! It's thicker than any belt I've had. It could possibly work as a dress belt but because it's so thick, it really seems more like a casual belt with lots of style.  It looks just like the picture, deep burgundy with the saddle grooves appearing a bit brighter.  Just the right amount of red.  Any less red would have been too subtle and any brighter red would have been too loud. Spot on! The saddle grooves also give the belt just enough detail in the leather, doesn't make it overly fancy. It's an amazingly sturdy belt.  If I ever have to make a Tango and Cash style get-a-way using my belt,  I have full confidence this belt will perform. Thanks for reading."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Do not put in dryer as it will shrink.  Not happy with Ruby's Rubish logo on the back should either, it is white and too big."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"I thought the material for this blouse was a nice jersey or cotton, instead it is synthetic, which in my opinion made the blouse look and feel cheap. I haven't worn it, and don't plan to. If it wasn't so expensive to return it, I would have ages ago!<br \/>Note though, if you don't have a problem with synthetic fabric, that the blouse has a nice fit to it, and the colours look good."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"I could not even get the shirt over my head, the sleeves were poorly cut (crooked) and not hemmed. Would not order from this company again."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It would be perfect if it actully fit. I would suggest getting one size up then you really are. I'm a size x-large and I fit like a large."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"The sleeve is Too short, not same as what the picture show. There is a big gap between the sleeve & gloves. My arm are not long. look like long sleeves in picture, but actually short sleeves. Very disappointed. Look cheap!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This little summer dress is so adorable.  I also bought a<br \/>pair of white cotton bloomers and had a little girls<br \/>name embroidered.  They are perfect together.<br \/>Can't go wrong with this dress!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I ordered the 16H for my son who is currently wearing a 14H in most other brands.  Even though I ordered up a size he was unable to button them."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"After waiting 5 weeks I was disappointed as when ordered it was a V neck also as a large T shirt it is very small. No invoice was in the parcel and I would like to return this item please email me an address. Amazons merchants have so far let me down some cant find a 6 year old new build so I cannot have the T shirts really wanted and this is a big disappointment. I have had only good say to say on other sites."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very pretty bra. I have been wearing these bras for years. No wires and best of all no padding. For as big as I am on top, why would I want more padding in there?"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Highly recommend the Levi's.  Fit perfectly, seems like the 34 was too small and 36 was too big at our local stores so was glad to find the 35's."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"nice belt"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These wool shirts are great for when it is a little chilly and a T-shirt alone won't do and a coat is too much.  Amazon offered a wonderful price for these shirts and the selection was great."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Super cute. I did get the ribbons tacked on at cleaners so that she couldn't untie them."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I bought these with another pair (529 curvy bootcut) for my wife. She liked them both but there was one thing that I think she will eventually grow tired of. These have a button down flap over the rear pocket and anytime I have had a pair of pants with a pocket flap you always face the dilemma of either having to keep securing the flap or have it eventually start to bunch up and stick out. Other than that though, a great pair of jeans."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"They fit, they are comfy, the white is bleachable which I like for undies. And the cotton breathes, which is so great."}

Just get it.<br \/><br \/>As far as sizing: I got a large and I'm a 5'8&#34; female.  I should have gotten a smaller size since it was a mens sizing chart, but I was worried it could fit weird.  Large was good though for the purpose of an Ugly Sweater Contest and now my boyfriend can borrow it for next year. :)"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I purchased the MPE to look more impressive when I go to a party or at the pool.  In the past, I tried other options, like padded underwear and big boy, but they never really worked.  This cup really works.  It produced a nice, large bulge in my pants.  It was very comfortable to wear.  I immediately saw that women were noticing the large contour.  It definitely helped me get several phone numbers.  I would recommend it for any guy like me who isn't well-endowed but wants to appear impressive."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This hat is so nice and toasty.  It keeps me warm out in this lovely snow filled winter we are having in the mid-Atlantic region this year.  It is also super cute.  I have received many compliments as well."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Got these for my wife and OMG! Sweet! She says they are comfortable too."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Worked for what I needed it for but the straps were too long so I had to sew them under (no big deal). Very scratchy though, I wore a slip to prevent that. The quality was great and appropriate for a country club. I'm a size 18-20 and it fit perfect."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This seller has some very unique tops. The colors and print on this shirt is bright and beautiful. I have washed it several times and there is no sign of fading or shrinkage. Fits great. It does however take quite a while for shipment as it was not made in the US."}

You can go to the beach or even an evening barbeque.  I read  other reviews and ordered a size up (from M to L) a it runs a little small, and it fits as I hoped.  Color is just as pictured and for the price - I think you'd be happy with your purchase."}

Let me tell you, This robe falls below the knee and is much thinner than cotton Terry cloth, yet warm and toasty.  I wear a size 12 and the Medium fits perfectly.  It is well made and I am sure it will be your favorite robe as it is mine."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I have been wearing Playtex 18 Hour Bras for most of my adult life because they are durable and very comfortable to wear.  I highly recommend them to all women.  Amazon.com has a good selection of larger bra sizes.  I couldn't believe these prices and was skeptical about buying them.  When I received them, I washed them, and they look exactly like the higher priced Playtex 18 Hour Bras I have been purchasing.  Thank you for selling them.  I didn't find any flaws in any of the nine I purchased.  They launder nicely and last a long time.  Once you ever wear Playtex 18 Hour Bras, you most likely won't ever wear another brand because they will spoil you to other bras because of their comfort level.  The toffee color is a neutral color."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This item came in one week earlier than expected! It is very comfortable and very well-made! The waist is elastic, so you don't have to worry about fiddling with buttons or anything! It's very, very pretty, and very cute."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I normally wear a 34DD, so that's what I ordered. When I tried the bra on for the first time, I thought the band was super snug, but the cups fit fine, and the bra passed the &#34;jumping up and down in front of the mirror test&#34; with flying colors. Plus, I think this color combo is actually kind of cute, and I like that this bra doesn't compress like other sports bras I own. So I shrugged it off as &#34;eh, I can get it hooked, and it'll probably stretch out anyway.&#34;<br \/><br \/>Turns out when I went to take the tags off, it's a 32E, not a 34DD. As noted, I can close it on the loosest hooks, and I'm sure it'll stretch, so I kept it, and I was pleased with how it worked at my HIIT class today. But I almost returned it just on principle--I realize 32E and 34DD are the same cup size, but they aren't the same band, and I'd prefer to get what I pay for."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I am medium built, Size 10 & this (barely) fits me. However, if you are a Women's size 12\/14 & up don't waste your money honey. It's comfy & cute but, not made for more curvier women. I hope this helps."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"This dress is not 70% Cotton\/22% Wool\/8% Elastane, but 100% cotton.<br \/>The material is not much different than sweatshirt material.  This is not entirely amazon's fault, it is also listed incorrectly on the French connection site.<br \/>The cut is nice for a casual dress, but I hoped to wear it to work.<br \/>It also appears that French Connection has shifted to American sizing.<br \/>A size down would have been more fitted.<br \/>Am still deciding if I should return it."}

I bought these light blue overalls so I can garden in them without my butt crack showing when bent over and also for rock hounding chipping away rock from cliffs and bedrock.. I felt the light blue would be a faded soft blue yet thick material.. These are the bomb if you are active and want comfort and practibility.  I think I could get used to these even for doing chores around the house and for hiking....did I mention comfortable?  You betcha!"}

Each of these bows may have lasted a couple days as the bow is not glued to the clip but instead is taped on, so with any simple tug on the bow it falls apart.

I'm disabled and very rarely go out so I was looking for something warm to wear around the house.  First thing I noticed was they weren't very thick and the first time our puppy jumped up on me, they tore.  My husband says if I had worn them properly and put clothes over them instead of wearing them as pajamas they would be toasty warm as I expected.  I have very small feet and had a difficult time putting my feet  through.<br \/><br \/>I do agree with my husband that they be super warm had I worn clothes over them so I'm going to give the product 3 stars, taking one star off for the feet and another because how easily the fabric tore."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love Karen Kane tops. Wash well. Wear well. Flattering, especially this model and all the handkerchief hem models. Too bad she's stopped the travel collection as it was fantastic. The quality of the travel pants is so good I bought five pair...and the matching jacket."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The material feels\/looks like a jacket and it's not as slim as it is in the picture (but that's probably because I'm really skinny). I'm 5'9&#34; and 125 pounds and I got a medium."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Got these gloves in 3 colors, brown, green and black. After receiving my first pair I could not get quick enough back on this site to order 2 more pair. I also ordered the matching scarfs. Ladies these are absolutely wonderful, not only is the fit fabulous, but they are so very, very warm. Let's face it, how in the world are you going to beat the price. Don't miss out on these. I would order the red gloves also, if they had the red scarf to match (they don't) Have only the highest praise for these gloves and thank the seller for making these so very affordable."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This was more than worth the money, well made and just as described. It was a gift and the recipient loved it."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great belt - excellent thick leather with nice detailing and perfect round holes, buckle is solid and handsome. The best belt for jeans, cargo pants, tactical pants!<br \/>Like most belts, specify length at least 2 inches longer than what your waist size is to have it fit properly."}

It was way too small, I'm normally an xl in shirts, I considered the other reviews I read,so I ordered this shirt in a size XXL. This shirt was more like a loose fit medium. Since the shirt was pretty, I kept it and gave it to my 15 yr old daughter."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"BON BEBE IS AN EXCELLENT GLOBAL MARK...I RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS VERY GOOD AND IT IS OF EXCELLENT QUALITY FOR CHILDREN."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I listened to other reviews which were 100% correct. Runs small by one size and fabric is summer weight, even though it looks heavier online. I would add suspenders are not elastic, extremely cheap looking and difficult to adjust. Ordered for family pics--one time wear. Worth it as my grandsons looked adorable!!!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These socks are mostly cotton with a small amount of synthetic material for stretch. Hard to find cotton socks with stretch where the percentage of cotton is higher than the stretch percentage. My feet sweat and synthetic socks make it worse. These socks keep my feet dryer and feel great on the feet. Great find, these socks."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Both outfits super duper cute.  Will be great summer outfits.  Great quality as Carters clothing usually is.  Size is as expected, possibly runs a wee bit smaller than other 12 month infant clothing but not by much.  Shipping was speedy. Items exactly as pictured."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fits great! I wanted a shorter pair of swim trunks, but no so short that it would be almost like a pair of underwear.  These do the trick just fine! The color is a true black and the leg opening is a good size: not too big, not too small. Great quality!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Really great boxers. They fit properly, don't get overly stretched out and stitching is well done. The fly is open though (no button or snap to keep it closed), but that doesn't bother me too much. Even the patterns are nice! I will definitely buy a lot more of these!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very comfortable, easy to wear. Nice fit when walking and sitting. Highly recommend."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I have several Hawaiian style shirts from different places, but my three KY shirts are my favorites because of their unique patterns and comfy cotton fabric. These shirts run a little small. I normally wear a 2X, but have to order 3X from KY."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This sun hat was a good fit. The bow in the back is alittle cumbersome for lounging by the pool, tends to Hirt the back of your head. Great if your sitting reading, no napping......LOL"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This is a comfortable, economical choice for a hoodie.  What puzzles me is the pricing.  The 75% cotton 25% poly hoodies are less than 20 dollars each.  Thes cost more and the blend is 50 cotton 50 poly.  I don't get it ALTHOUGH I do admit that I find this one more comfortable, I think that the higher cotton, lower priced option provides more warmth.  Either way, this one is still half the cost or more for an Under Armour or Nike hoodie.  Great for the budget conscious AND it's a FINE product from a fairly great quality, and reputable company that's been around for awhile.  Used to be second to none.<br \/><br \/>wfn"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"So beautiful!!! I loved"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This was our choice, after a long search.  It's reasonably hard sided, and it looks like  more expensive stuff.  It rolls very well, and eliminates the need to be gouged for a rental cart.  It's also the right size for at least one of our airlines.  Good stuff."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great quality screen printing at a great price. Colors and bright and on target."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The fabric is awesome! It's just a little too big. However, with winter coming I can layer and it will have a much better fit. My husband loved the way it looked. It fits like a dress down to my knees. I was wanting it to fit like a long shirt. Over all I like it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love the color and they keep my feet warm."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Fits well. A little loose in the waist area but gives a cute comfy feel. Not super form fitting if that's what you were expecting, but fits nicely. Super comfortable."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I thought this scarf would be less sheer but i really like it anyway.  Its a good length, longer than most one would put around your head, almost reaches the elbow.  Its classy, yet there is a little rebel that comes with wearing a Scull Scarf"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Bought for costume party. Great color. Perfect length. However, hair started coming off towards end of the night. Arrived on time."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Some of the threads on the cleaning rods were striped out. Not a big deal because I only have a 16in barrel but it could have been prevented with some quality control. But every thing else in the kit is nice"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love these jeans.  They fit comfortably like yoga pants but look like great jeans.  The quality is good too.  My only complaint is I wish the pockets were slightly deeper so my phone would fit better in a pocket.  They are 5 star in my book."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"a finely made mask for any event. Its a nice mask made of recycled materials then some form of paint coating over it, its flexible, durable, and has a really nice look to it, I can see people using this for any event or play or party. its so nicely done that it held up to buckets of my sweat on a hot day"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"These are for children."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Changing my rating from 5 to 4.  Why?  For some reason, after you've worn this type of underwear, it begins to develop an unusual odor, sort of like a plastic smell.  Washing reduces the odor, but the older they get, the less the washing does anything to resolve the problem.  I'm convinced it's the material itself.  It appears to lock in this unpleasant smell (smell which does NOT happen with 100% cotton underwear -- so while they feel wonderful to wear, this will become a problem.    FINALLY!  A GOOD feeling set of underwear.  This brand is gorgeous.  The material is silky soft, and it breathes so well you can be covered up with a blanket while sleeping and NOT have sweat in all the wrong places!  When you're walking around with your street clothes on, you cannot even FEEL these underwear.  They are absolutely &#34;got to have&#34; in my book.  I have no problem with bunching up while walking on a hot summer day, as this underwear glides across the skin like a couple of eggs in a Teflon frying pan. (no friction at all)  About the only issue I can mention is that when you're pulling up your long pants, sometimes the underwear might get pulled past your waistband, requiring some adjustment.  But that is a price I am VERY willing to pay, to have something that feels this good!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I was very impressed with the quality of this wig. I have worn it and had people ask me if it was my real hair. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because in the picture it looks more blue where as in person it looks more green."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"My only complaint is that its not as soft as I thought it was going to be, but its pretty good. I do like this better than the Carhartt regular T-shirt."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Good quality"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I ordered this, feeling iffy because of some of the bad reviews. However, it came in the mail earlier than the estimated delivery date (YAY!) and it fits perfectly! No tears, no loose threads, no defects. I really love it, and it's super cute too. Looks exactly like the picture. I was very impressed."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Love it! Got a size bigger cause I read runs a little small. Glad I did cause it fits perfect"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I like the material and the adjustable straps, but it is sized poorly. I ordered one size larger than I typically do, based on the size reviews, and it's still too tight for comfort."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great product, love the colors and it fits my boyfriend perfectly!"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"The material is nice and soft, but the finishing is terrible. Thread came undone on multiple pairs after washing (with the washer set to Delicates). These won't last long."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"item is as expected.  only drawback was that one of the onesies had a stain on it from where the tape held it together.  didn't come out in the wash.  :("}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It is well worth the money.... Love it!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"A nice medium weight shirt, it just runs a little small, so order the next size up from what you normally wear.  Bella is great with customer service."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"ordered in a 28DD, my usual size.  this is the first underwire bra in my size i've ever ordered that is actually comfortable on my sternum.  the inside of the bra has a tacky rubber-type lining that helps keep it in place.  comes with removable straps, and 2 hooks on the inside of the cups so you can choose where to attach the straps.  i haven't worn it for a long period of time yet, but is already more comfortable than every other underwired bra in this band size that i've ever tried.  i think this one's a keeper!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love this thing. I went to Ren-Fest as the Grim Reaper. I got so many Compliments. Its a little heavy. I was sweating pretty good. But it gives you the image of Death himself. I wish it had come with its own hood. I had to make one but it was fine. Great Buy."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Everyone thought I handmade my outfit. It was very nice for what I paid."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I have pretty much settled on this particular brand and style of pants. They fit well once you have found out what size you take, and sizes have always been consistent so I'm comfortable now ordering them on line. My go-to pants for work and play. Durable enough, I have had absolutely no problems with these over the years. Lots of options on the colors too, especially if you order online. Negligible shrinkage when first washed and dried, using the hot temps for both. I will stick with these."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It's fits great and it's funny !"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These shorts are AMAZING! Idk why all those negative reviews. They're extremely light (feels like you're wearing nothing) & just above the knee. The shorts are a little see-through but not to the part where you'll make a scandal whereever you go. I liked them so much I bought another pair in a different color."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The dress is very cute. I thought the dress was tea length but it is a typical short little girls dress and it is for summer only. The material is extremely light and soft. I bought it for a flower girl dress but it will not be worn for that reason. The dress is much smaller than I thought it would be for a size 4. However, this dress is beautiful for Easter, birthday party, or on a Sunday outing. The price of the dress was $36.00 and I actually think for a little summer dress I would not pay more than this.  I actually feel bad that I had emailed the store about delivery. Amazon sent an email with an incorrect delivery date. I paid for the expedited delivery and I received the dress exactly as promised at purchase checkout. I would order from this seller again."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Like the style.  Will great for the winter.<br \/>Am not a fan of fur, so removed the collar<br \/>and the coat look great."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I was looking for a letterman for my younger son after my older son got his from school. Most of the styles I came across were either too expensive for a 10-year-old to grow out of, or too flimsy. This jacket is great quality and was a great price! He loves it!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"When I first received notice that my tights wouldn't arrive for another month and a half, I was pretty let down.  However, they arrived about a week after I ordered them...from the UK.  They seem like great quality, but I haven't washed them or worn them very much yet.  The Large is comfortably snug for me and I am 5'9&#34; 190lbs and wear 34\/30 jeans.  For more support, I probably could have gone with the medium.  The waist is a bit higher than most other tights I've tried on, which is a plus and means that no one will ever mistake my backside for a vending machine (if you know what I mean).  They breath exceptionally well and are quite warm if you throw a shell over them.  I would feel comfortable wearing only these and my shell pants (and of course boots, shirt and jacket) for a day of backcountry in the single digits."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"it is not like the picture , the colors are lighter ,, in the picture it shows very very beautiful what I receives is accepted"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Giving it 4 stars cause I definitely see a difference and was given a few compliments along the way Only gripe is sizing was a bit small will go up one size when reordering bit still got.the job done even with size issue"}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Bad quality, looks cheap (brand Hanes), the print sucks! Don't know what happened here because I bought from cafepress before and never like this!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I really wish more stores would carry these socks because they are the only ones that don't hurt my feet. I'm stuck on these. I was a little confused and had trouble finding them because of the name change (they used to be Gold Toe Maxspun). And the ones I had were longer. But these ankle socks are enough where I have to work 8-10 hours a day standing. Regular socks I have to turn inside out to keep the fuzzies from grinding against my sensitive soles. Not Allpro. I'm stocking up on these and hope they are around a long time."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"I am a bigger woman, I purchased this because my husband liked how it looked.  The boning is very weak and it bends, it is not rigid and offers no support at all.  This WILL NOT cinch your waist, not even a couple inches.<br \/>The sizing is off, as the sizing directions said to order your band size, or if you wear a DDD+ to order one band size higher.  I wear a 46DDD and ordered a 46.  The cups were much too big, I would have to have another cup size to fill them.  the waist fit alright, but pretty much closed completely.  I could have ordered a 44 or even 42 and it probably would have been a better fit.<br \/><br \/>This is gorgeous, but the fit was just not right and it's definitely a lingerie only item, don't expect it to offer any shaping at all."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Very nice but run big. Buy a size smaller."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This jacket is great! The arm length is long enough, which is often not the case with other jackets and sweatshirts I buy. (I am 5'10). It's made well and it's nice and warm. Love the pattern on the arms. Picture doesn't do it justice. I bought a large based upon Tilly's size chart, and I am glad I did. Not too small and not too big, so perfect!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"So Q\u3002"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It's soft, and fits just right.  It's a nice solid soft sweater without being too heavy.  No itchies, no static, no see through.  I wish it came in different colors. I'd definitely buy more than one.  Patty is the only seller I buy clothes from online anymore. :)"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"My husband works outside 5 days a week, so layers are important.  The large fit him well, though at 5'10&#34; , I had expected them to be a little long, they were not. He wore them immediately and said they were very comfortable against his skin and amazingly warm for a base layer. A great buy for the money, good construction and appears will last through multiple seasons."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"The best way to describe this robe is it has the same feel as a terry cloth towel, and not a very soft one.  This robe was not the thickness I expected for the price, shedding from the time I removed it from it's box.  I am not at all impressed, except I do like the length and the fact it has a hood.  Other than that, disappointed to say the least."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I have worn this product twice now and I love it.  It's very comfortable and breathable.  I only wish I could find the matching pants on the website.  Unfortunately, the ones with the same color scheme don't seem to be available."}

My husband had lost his last expander about a month before I gave Amazon a try.  Amazed again, I can find anything here!  These arrived promptly in the middle of the holiday mailing rush.  They allow at least a full extra size of comfort to the collar, maybe 1.5 sizes.  Not visible behind the tie knot.  These expanders save shirts that fit well everywhere but need a larger collar.  Worth their weight in gold!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I had to return because it was just too short, and I have a short torso.  Beautiful color, love the flared sleeves.  but a bit pricey to keep if not 100% satistfied"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I had such a hard time finding a sports bra that does not make you look like you have a uniboob.  This fits great I am a 38F.  I have always wore an underwire bra under a regular sports bra but with this bra you have all the support for high impact sports and shows off your nice curves without the uniboob look.  I love it so much that I just ordered it in white and cafe.  So comfortable and looks great under tee shirts.  Love it."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This wallet replaced my 10 year old tri-fold Dockers wallet. With my Dockers wallet I nearly struggled for space as it was meant to hold about 6 cards. It was so bad that I had to triple stack cards in order to make room. My Dockers wallet was a work horse until the leather started to peel off and the stitching no longer held together. So I went on the hunt to find the perfect replacement. I looked at $30+ wallets like Tommy Hilfiger, Polo, Dockers, Nautica, etc..etc. Non of them offered anything much more compelling than the sub $20 wallets I was comparing. So after a couple hours of reading reviews from other Amazoners I found this wallet. I compared it to a $20 TommyH trifold wallet but this blew it out the water when it came to storage space per dollar. Even though the TommyH wallet was really nice and had four times the amount of reviewers, this one had my name on it. ;-)<br \/><br \/>Once it arrived to my house doorstep and after opening the package (smelling the new leather aroma) I found it to be little longer than my Dockers since this is a bifold and my Dockers was a trifold. The good news is that I no longer have to stack cards (12 slots vs 6). I have plenty of spots to store cash, change, pancakes and still have room spare. The leather feels really nice and smooth across my finger tips. The material and stitching felt very durable and high quality. And best yet this wallet is very thin and light.<br \/><br \/>My only complaint about this wallet is that if you put a card in the 4th card slot it will block cards stored in the 3rd slots. So in order to see whats in the 3rd card slots you would have to pull out the 4th card to see. So it may be a good idea to put your most important and most used cards on the upper slots and the least important and least used cards on the lower slots.<br \/><br \/>If you are looking for a high quality wallet for under $15 and you need plenty of room to store cards, then this is the wallet you need.<br \/><br \/>When I first opened the wallet up for the first time their was price tag on it and it said, \\\\\"MSRP $45\\\\\". You won't find anything at this quality and low price at any Wally Mart."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I have always wanted one of these hats to keep my head warm and also my ears.. Wearing Earmuffs and a hat was too much for me, I felt smothered. So when I saw this on Amazon, I was thrilled, only because I see them in the store's but they are Only for Children, so when I saw it was a Women's Hat I couldnt wait to get it. I got it for myself for Christmas in the Black and White, it goes with everything I have and I love it that its 1 piece and not 2(hat and earmuffs)... Thankyou so much for this nice hat that I have always wanted since I was little."}

I am an hourglass or pear shape and have a smaller middle than top. I expected it to be loose throughout.

I always have a hard time finding pants that are long enough for me. These were perfect. The waist does stretch out a little with wear. I notice they are tighter after drying them. They are pretty see through too which isn't a big deal with the black. I can't say about other colors but I definitely wouldn't buy white if it's a choice!"}

Also, the color on the website is a darker red but the actual color is a bright red. I still like it, but would have liked the color shown better. I am going to need to hem the bottom because it's too long for me. I'm 5'1, and it falls several inches below my knees. I did purchase a 26&#34; petticoat to wear with it, but it looks good either way (better with, in my opinion). The neckline is not nearly as sexy as it looks like it would be from the picture. I have a pretty large chest so I never have to work hard for cleavage, but this top covers it all up. Overall, it's a nice dress. It will definitely need some ironing before wearing. Four stars because the color is off from what's shown."}

Ignore the review in here that talks about it being cheaply made and not worth the money!!! I'm so glad I did. The dress also seems to run slightly small. I ordered an XS and it fits perfectly. I wear a 30B bra and a 00 jean so make sure you pay attention to the sizing chart. Anyway, the dress is beautiful and the perfect thing for my beach wedding. It is lined, but still a relatively thin material and the only thing you'll need to do is make sure you have a well fitting strapless bra, the back is plenty high enough to cover it. On me at least, the back sits just above where your bra would."}

My oldest one (over 5 years old) is starting to get worn out so I felt very lucky to find a replacement online.  I can't seem to find them in the department stores anymore."}

I ended up purchasing another pair different design though."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I, as many people are, am very picky about my socks. I dont like them if they are too tight and cut off circulation but I like it even less if they fall down my ankles and bunch up in my shoes. When I first put these on, the fit seemed a little tight but after going through the wash the fit is perfect. ( I have a size 11 shoe) Best of all, they do not fall down. (yeah!) The design and workmanship is very good with these socks. They are double layered and still are cool and lightweight. They have extra stretch in all the right places, like a built in arch support that really works. I bought two pair and have worn them each about a dozen times. They show no signs of wear yet. I have wore them to work, on my feet for 10+ hours and also worn them for day off activities and around the house. No disapointment at all, actually I am very pleased. May not wear them a lot in the winter as they are great for summer but dont seem to have any thermal charateristics."}

The only problem, which I'm certain is due to them being a size smaller, is that they pull up a little high in the front, creating a bit of a camel toe.<br \/><br \/>Otherwise, these jeggings make my butt look great, and fit well. They bunch up a bit at the bottom, (I'm 5'7, by the way) but for a casual day to day look this is perfect."}

Everything was labeled in English & Korean but in a format very similar to the ones in America.  More importantly, the companies address & my home address was prominent which makes it easier for delivery.  I have received packages in the past where the labels were difficult to read if I wanted to return it.

The jacket is well made, the quality is high, and there are zippered pockets inside -- something rare for women's clothes.  The tailoring is stylish, but the sizes run small.  I normally wear between and 18 and a 20, so I ordered the 20.  It was too snug, moreso because all the stress goes to one button.  I sent it back.  If it had fit, I probably would have sent it back anyway:  in retrospect, the price is just too high."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Awesome shirt, very patriotic. But they failed to mention that when you wear this Mountain Combat Stryker Adult T-shirt Tee, Chuck F'in Norris appears out of thin air. Startled the first time it happened I threw the shirt off and he instantly disappeared; like a ninja were to use a ninja vanish smoke ball. (the puff of smoke was not expected) After realizing what had happened I donned my newly purchased Mountain Combat Stryker Adult T-shirt Tee a second time, Chuck Norris appears again. I walked around my house and he would follow me with a glint in his eye and a smirk, every time Id look back at him.     I got into my car to drive to the local mall but he did not get in with me. Instead he ran next to my car as I drove, without breaking so much as a single bead of sweat, he kept up with me as I drove at freeway speeds. A car in the lane next to me started merging into my lane but right before the car would have smashed into me, Chuck threw himself between the two speeding masses of metal, and punched the car back into the lane it came from. Chuck looking back over his shoulder at me with that same glint and smirk then gave me a thumbs up, his leather glove with hanging tassels only amplified the intense situation I just witnessed.    After parking I proceeded to make my rounds to a few stores, receiving head nod after head nod and countless thumbs up from fellow pedestrians. Then... I saw them... the same group of bad guys who had kidnapped that family... from that one time... They leered at me with what I only could imagine were bad intentions to do \\\\\"bad guy\\\\\" stuff. The leader, wearing not one but 2 eye patches leaned forward to swing at me.... but was stopped by what sounded like a sonic boom!! It was the sound of Chuck Norris and his legendary roundhouse kick. The force of the kick had sent the bad guy more than 30 feet through the wall of the shop behind them! The other bad guys looked at Chuck and started pulling out various weapons from nunchucks to cattle prods, brass knuckles and metal chain. Chuck smirked, raised his arm and motioned to them and said \\\\\"I don't initiate violence, I retaliate.\\\\\" And with that the bad guys charged. Norris stood his ground till the last second and with one blinding lightning fast roundhouse kick, sent all of the bad guys into the same hole made by their bad guy boss.    After the carnage a young child stood standing there, the top of his ice cream cone laid on the ground in front of him. With his jaw open in amazement. I walked over to him and took off my Mountain Combat Stryker Adult T-shirt Tee and put it on the child Chuck Norris appeared again standing next to the child. I knelt down to the child's eye level and said \\\\\"I wont be needing this anymore\\\\\" And walked away into the sunset, never to be seen again. I wrote this review on my way into the sunset."}

It's a good thing they do start out slightly generous, because they shrunk.  A lot.  They still fit, but are now verging on being a capri instead of a full length pant.  (I'm 5'8&#34; and bought a large.)  Really disappointing, and I'm considering returning them.  I did buy two pairs and haven't yet washed the second pair, so will be sure to let those air dry.

I get compliments on the necklace all the time. The women who see my outfit don't realize that it is the layering with this modest cropped top under my v-neck simple t-shirt and a very basic skirt with neutral shoes that is the secret to a modest and becoming outfit.  When pairing with the simple v-neck, t-shirt make sure that the sleeves of the t-shirt end above the bust line.  Then, underneath, the modest cropped top with it's 3\/4 sleeve length will draw the eye to the end of that sleeve line.  This draws away from attention to the bust line as happens with many short sleeve t-shirts that stop at that point.  Of course, the v-neck is filled in with color of the modest top underneath.  I also pair the white and cream tops underneath Lands End * Womens Lightweight Cotton Model Crossover Shirt in Cyan Blue, Light Meadow Mist or Pink Flamingo with a necklace and A-line skirt.  For a formal look, I have paired the black modest cropped top with Macy's * Alfani Mulit-PrintPeplum Bat-wing sleeve blouse.  A black skirt and clear necklace looped twice looked great with this for a more formal occasion."}

Well made down to every last detail with a sapphire crystal and screw down crown. The thick leather band is high quality, stitched, double riveted, passes the sniff test and looks to be indestructible. This is a very comfortable watch that is not too heavy and lays flat on top of my wrist. It's easy to read too with the charcoal grey contrasts on the dial.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought this for my spouse.  We both grew up in Miami in the days BEFORE anyone knew anything about the dangers of burning in the sun, or why we should use sunscreen NOT suntan oil...in fact I'm not sure there WAS sunblock then, if there was, I didn't know about it.<br \/>People our age laid out on the beach or in their yards slathered with oil in order to get as dark as possible.  That sounds incredibly dumb now but not as dumb as the people who still go to tanning beds when we all know the dangers of sun exposure...<br \/>Anyway, my spouse has already had several small skin cancers removed from the face and has to see the dermatologist every 3-4 months to be checked out...The sun damage done when one is young is the worst of all, and most dangerous, just an fyi to those who, like me, were badly burned as kids before anyone knew better.  The sun's rays: UVA--think of A for aging, that is what makes people who are in the sun often, or who purposefully tan or go to tanning beds,  look like old dried out leather; UVB---that is the burning that can eventually come back as cancer.  Much skin cancer is trivial and can be removed in the dermatologist's office. Other types, like melanoma, are lethal cancers that can spread to other organs and kill you.<br \/>Having said all that---- I have to applaud the Coolibar people, and other clothing manufacturers who are creating clothes to protect from the sun's rays. They  are doing us all a service.  Coolibar--I think they started in Australia---not sure---are so serious about this they don't even sell short sleeved shirts other than swim shirts.  And they have a large number of hats of all kinds, kid's clothes, and so on....I just wish they were less expensive! Their online site is good, has several types of sunblock and many more clothes.<br \/><br \/>The shirt itself is soft, doesn't feel \\\\\"odd\\\\\" or unusual or as if it's made from some unusual fabric. Feels just like a soft, prewashed comfortable tee shirt.  I like the soft neutral colors too.<br \/><br \/>  I would encourage anyone who is out in  the sun often, for any reason, to purchase at least one of these shirts or the equivilent.  All of the Coolibar brand clothes are UPF 50, whereas some of the other \\\\\"sun protective\\\\\" clothes sold online and in stores are 30 or 40 SPF, so read the \\\\\"fine print\\\\\".  I'm sure most of us can afford at least one or two \\\\\"sun protective\\\\\" shirts, and a regular hat with a brim to wear when outdoors!  It could be lifesaving!I would encourage anyone who is out in  the sun often, for any reason, to purchase at least one of these shirts or the equivilent.

It looked nice and customer service was pleasant but could not exchange it for another product offering me a 20% credit, my only option with cost of shipping it back to China prohibitive."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love this hat.  Simple, but cute, and functional.  I wear it in the winter or when there's moisture in the air.  I keep thinking I'll add some kind of embellishment to give it a little more style, but I haven't done it yet and I still get compliments on it whenever I wear it.  Even though it's not a rain hat, I have worn it in many rain storms and it keeps my hair dry.  Just let it air out and dry completely before putting it back in the closet.<br \/><br \/>I love that it's crushable and not fussy."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I bought these solely for the purpose of lounging at home and to sleep in. They are quite comfortable but not aesthetically pleasing as the sizes run large and the bottom extends more than your average sweatshirt. But, then again, I got these for lounging at home and they fit the bill."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very nice skirt. I'm 5'7, 135 lbs and I bought a XL despite having a very tiny waist. It's a little bit. Could have gone with a large but overall it's good quality, nice fabric. Recommend buying"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I recommend these pants highly. If you need to wash them as often as I do though I would get one size larger in the waist due to shrinkage. I also recommend a suspender if you do a lot of bending. The double knee has an opening so you can use a set of insertable knee pads.<br \/>Spend the money and get Carhartt if you want guaranteed quality and proven performance."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love this hat!! It is beautiful!"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"I'm 5'3, 100lb, and ordered a medium. Top is made of a weird material that bunches up and was too loose. The waste was too tight, it was very difficult to get on, and once it was on I felt like if I ate or drank anything the costume would have dug into my stomach\/waste area, and I'm tiny. My chest still hurts from having to pull the costume on over my head. The lights are only in the front (I read this before I ordered, and was not concerned) however, the strings of lights have creases in them. The wand blinked 3 different ways, but there was no option for it to be on without blinking. The wings are pretty but the elastic bands that you wear to hold them up are a little tight. I wouldn't recommend this costume to anyone."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"This rain jacket serves it's purpose. However, I wish that I had known prior to purchasing it that it does not have a hood."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"After shopping at malls for a few weeks I decided to try Amazon and found this beautiful, reversible coat. When it arrived I was totally blown away by the quality. When the faux fur is worn on the inside it keeps me toasty warm, when worn on the outside I feel I am dressed for any lavish occasion. I would recommend this coat."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I was seeking a sleeveless bodysuit (onesie) for my granddaughter so she could keep her tummy warm while wearing some of her favorite tops (not onesies).  This one fit the bill.  The sizing is true for the larger size such as 9 to 12 months, it is generously sized for the 12 month old but works quite well being a bit large for now until she grows into the large size.      The quality is quite acceptable and my ever skeptical daughter-in-law has been using them beneath the cute short tops.  I only wish these came in solid white, but the pinks are cute and easy to coordinate.      Thanks...."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"But this jersey is great, and has the additional bonus of no free advertising.  The pockets were great for light jacket, phone, wallet, keys,and the fit was so much better than a Pearl Izumi that cost 3x."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I was worried.  My testosterone level was on the low end of normal. Being close to forty and falling into the sedimentary geological scale.  I guess it should be expected.  But, I bought this shirt and began breathing fire the moon began to exert its inexplicable pull on me.  I found myself prowling the woods during night.  I could only look at luna and begin howling.  Since getting this shirt I've started running at night lighting my way with my new found power of fire breathing.  My testosterone level has increased to the high end of high.  I won't say the shirt is responsible.  Causation and correlation has not been tested.  But, I will say that this shirt is responsible for so much awesome that any buyer should be wary."}

A hole in one of the pockets and a rip on the inside. I wish I would have known the material is so cheap. I wouldn't have bought it."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"The bottoms are HUGE and look like pajamas.  So not cute"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I was skeptical about buying this belt because it had no reviews. But being the first to write a review I can say that I'm so happy I bought it! It came within a day or 2 of ordering it! I have a smaller waist so I was worried that the smallest adjustable size might be too small but it fits perfectly! There is a long hook chain so you can easily adjust the belt to fit you. Love it so much I'm really glad I purchased it!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I wear a 36FF and it fits perfectly!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought this costume as a backup costume for Halloween since my other one which is coming from China still hasn't arrived (as of 11\/5) when I ordered it in like two weeks advance of Halloween. But that's my bad. However I sold myself on this one being how it was less than $25 and when will I not find a reason to not dress as a banana again?<br \/><br \/>Turns out everyone loves a person dressed as a banana giving out shots of banana liquor at a Halloween party. I'm a 6'2&#34; tall man and it fit great. Everything went better than expected and now I've raised the bar on how to be awesome during Halloween. 10\/10 would recommend."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Appearance:  Better than in the picture, (I purchased the yellow lenses, chrome plastic) but slightly big. The tint is way darker when you wear it (ex. bright yellow is orangy-yellow). They are also pretty awesome because I had almost 20 people come up to me and say they were cool when I was just wearing them around.    Fit:  The foam on the back of the piece that rests on your face takes some breaking in and becomes \/very\/ uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them. There is a slight problem with the bottom: it fits in a certain way that you can see everything from a gap from a certain angle but this defiantly does not affect the appearance. The strap somewhat slips so you have to adjust it occasionally, but thats to be expected.    Design:  It protects against UV rays so that is a bonus. The black frame behind the lenses and mount is somewhat flimsy but fine for everyday wear."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My dad loved it, he said it was just as described and exactly what he was looking for!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I really like this bra. When I got it, I was afraid it would be uncomfortable because it is made of some sort of rough material, but it is awesome. The mesh-like fabric seems to breathe fine and the fit is just right. The edges are scalloped with the embroided roses and it is really pretty. I ordered the other color after having the first one for about two weeks. As a larger, well-endowed woman, I was really happy to get a low cut bra that holds the girls comfortably without spillage."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I didn't know it came with velcro on the back which is awesome! A little bigger than I expected (which isn't that bad)."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Not as long as I hoped it would be, but it's great material and a cute simple design and the price was great."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I absolutely loved it, at first I was really concerned in how this costume was going to fit. I'm 126 lbs. 5'1 and the small fitted perfectly! I'm in love with it. Yeah the material isn't all that and the armor is foam material but it's great for cosplay. The only thing I didn't like is that the cape is not long at all like in the picture. But I can just buy a longer cape at party city or something no problem. But other than that it fit as expected. I give it a thumbs up."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"The fabric in these pants is like a travel knit.  They were too long for me when I got them, but not unacceptably long.  However, as I wore them they stretched more and more!  By the end of the day, I was stepping on the pant legs.  Maybe I will try throwing them into a hot dryer to see if they shrink."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This robe was for my husband who is 6' 2&#34; and weighs 225 pounds. I ordered the 2XL size and I think the fit is just right, but he says it's a little too big and probably could have gone with the 1XL.  It's very light weight and warm and his only complaint is that the inside tie is sewn in way too high.  Nowhere near his waist.  This is a lot better than I could have found in the store where every man's robe is &#34;one size fits all&#34;.  I will be ordering this brand again."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very cute and made with great material. I can't wait to buy more. Kind of long and I love the rhinestones I hope they stay on after washes. They seem to be put on well."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My niece loved it."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Arrived on time, well packed. Product is as described, design is nice, I like it very much, worth the price. The only issue is the size is definitely on the small side. I ordered a M, it fits like S or XS of the US size. So order one or two size larger should help."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"They are just as I expected. They fit him good. levi's are always good jeans. and this is just because the wanted more words."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love these jeans so much I bought several pairs. They are comfortable, look good on me and even though I have larger hips and some belly weight these are slenderizing. I've bought so many other pair that either stretch too much by the end of the day or they look sloppy or baggy. These are a very nice jean and I only wish I could get them in additional colors. I've been losing weight as well so I stick to this brand and have been able to order a size smaller as I am getting smaller. I hope I'll have to buy a lot of smaller sizes in the future.  :-)"}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"The outfit did not work at all. Total waste of my money. The top does not hold my wife's chest in and the cords are complicated to figure out. I thought about cutting the top off and keeping the pants but even they are baggy. I got robbed once again from China."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I was extremely nervous to buy maternity scrubs (or any scrubs!) from the internet, but was having no luck finding a selection in stores.  However, these fit wonderfully!  I am 25 weeks pregnant with my 3rd with a big ole belly. I'm 5'5 and currently weigh about 180lb, and I got a medium.  I am not sure what my regular scrub size is because each brand is so different.  The mediums hug my hips, knees, and butt just enough to keep my shape but not enough that they are tight at ALL.  I hate that almost all maternity pants are flare leg.  Who wants a giant flare leg whipping around their ankles when they are already bigger than normal!?  These are a little more than a bootcut opening.<br \/><br \/>I am ordering a second pair now because I just can't resist.  Pulling up that so-soft belly band around my big belly was so comfy, it makes my 12 hour shifts bearable!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This top is very comfortable and flattering. I love how it opens up from the bottom for nursing as well as being able to be pulled down from the top. The one thing I have an issue with is the smell. Right out of the package it had this awful chemically smell. I've washed it 3 times so far and it still has the smell to it. Not sure what it is. Just hope it's not toxic for my baby to breathe in considering she spends so much time with her face in it. I got a size small and it fits nicely. I'm 5'6\\\\\" with a slim build."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"NOTE:  I received a free pair of these capris for review.<br \/><br \/>I exercise daily at home, and although I tend to purchase inexpensive workout clothing, it's great when I can look stylist and feel comfortable, too!  These Balance Tech capris are super-cute.  I got the Charcoal, a versatile dark gray color which has great blue and green accents in the dual colored elastic waistband and the adorable green adjustable ties that go around the calves.<br \/><br \/>The cotton\/spandex blend of these capris was comfortable to wear and conformed to my body well without being too clingy; I also found that the fabric breathed well while I was exercising.  I generally wear a medium (6 or 8) in most pants, and I found these capris true to size.  The one problem I had was with the elastic waistband:  when I put the capris on the first time, the waist didn't fit as snugly as I'd like, and after wearing the pants just a few times, it feels like it is stretching out even more.  This is a disappointment, as it makes me feel that I wouldn't be able to wear these cute capris outside of the house (i.e., to avoid a \\\\\"wardrobe malfunction\\\\\").  This is a shame, because otherwise, these capris are very cute and comfy.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE, 2\/15\/15:<br \/>I have downgraded my review to 3 stars due to the waistline issue I mentioned above.  Unfortunately, after just a few more wearings, the elastic band waistline has continued to lose its elasticity.  As of now, I wear these capris at-home only, but I fear that in another month or two, I may actually have to get rid of them altogether, as they barely stay on my waist as it is.  This product needs either a different type of elastic (i.e., higher quality) waistband or a drawstring to combat the loss of tension."}

This is a sweater sized &#34;fits most&#34; and the chest area is not an issue and would fit a woman up to 20\/22 dress size but the sleeves are so tiny the only person in our family that could fit their arms in the sleeves was a 9 year old girl and she said the sleeves still felt tight. The person in China who made this sweater must think us Americans are built like &#34;Whos from Who Ville&#34;. We are shipping it back, the only other option would be to cut the sleeves off and make it into a vest. But like I said we could see there was an issue the minute we took it out of the package the sleeves where so tiny you can see the problem even before trying it on.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very nice hat, love the style and feel of it.  It was a little large but my head is in between Medium and Large so it was not unexpected.  I took some 1\/4&#34; adhesive Velco, the soft loop side, and put it in a couple places under the inside band and it fits Great."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My family has been gearing up to go camping soon, and we had nothing but a tent so I was on the quest for camping supplies and stumbled across this fleece liner. Mind you, there are five of us, and we don't have a lot of money so I had to weigh all the options. Luckily for each of my three kids I found mummy bags rated to 20* on clearance for dirt cheap at stupid Wal-Mart, but still had nothing for me and the hubby. We happen to be a short family and the youth size mummy bags also fit my husband and I, but he insisted that we get something that we can zip together to sleep in, not just side-by-side. All of the sleeping bags that could zip together and were also rated about 20* were just WAY too expensive and that's when I thought that maybe I could get a warmer weather sleeping bag and add a liner to bring it down to 20 degrees or so for cheaper. Boy, was I right! I got a Mountain Trails sleeping bag rated to 40* and then added this Wenzel liner which brings us down to 25* at a much more affordable price tag. Plus we have the option of zipping our Mountain Trails Lindenwood sleeping bags together but each sleeping in a Wenzel liner inside the outer bag for added wind protection if it arises.<br \/><br \/>You can zip two of these liners together if need-be without a problem- just be warned that since they are made in China, one zipper may be an inch or so shorter than the other liner's zipper. Still not a probelm b\/c the velcro closure covers it to ensure it stays shut while sleeping. Heck, you could even zip the Mountain Trails sleeping bag on the bottom and the Wenzel liner on the top for more cush under you in the warmer months without all the bulk since they are from the same company! Also happens to be a hair smaller in length and width than the Mountain Trails sleeping bags so it fits inside perfectly without bunching or sticking out the top.<br \/><br \/>This liner not only has elastic straps to keep it rolled up, but also comes in a sturdy plastic, zippered bag with a handle that will prove to be a great carrier\/storage bag for the liners.<br \/><br \/>On a side note, I read reviews at Wal-Mart's site on this liner and people seemed to be under the impression that they were going to get a fleece blanket with a zipper on it. Let me clarify since the pictures on every website for this product do not do it justice. The outside is that silky, nylon-y type of material, and the inside is a thin fleece. It is two layers of fabric with no insulation between. It seems to be of good quality, and should withstand occassional camping usage. To be honest, my husband and I were so excited when we got them (b\/c they are so soft) that we put them on our bed zipped together and slept in them for several days before finally packing them away for the up-coming camping trip.<br \/><br \/>If you are an avid back-packer or camper, I don't know if this liner would hold up to daily usage, but with occassional usage it will definately do fine.<br \/><br \/>If you purchase these bags, order them with enough time to wash first though. They smelled like my cat's flea shampoo, so I'll bet that they were sprayed with some sort of pest\/bug repellant in the factory. I don't know about you but I wouldn't want to sleep on a pesticide-sprayed blanket even for one night. It took two washes to get the smell out with a free and clear natural detergent and then hung outside to air out and dry.<br \/><br \/>Overall, great product for the price if you know what you are getting first- but check around for the best price b\/c as I write this there is at least one other site (mentioned above) that offers it at a better price when they are not sold out of the Wenzel Fleece Liner.ith a handle that will prove to be a great carrier\/storage bag for the liners.<br \/><br \/>On a side note, I read reviews at Wal-Mart's site on this liner and people seemed to be under the impression that they were going to get a fleece blanket with a zipper on it.

The dress in the website looks decent and well made. But what they sell to me was a piece of garbage! I can tell that the dress that the model was wearing was made with quality material, but the dress they sell to their costumers was made of very cheap fabric, cheaper than a halloween costumes. When I wear this dress, the fitting is kinda baggy. The color and print of my underwear is very visible due to a very thin and cheap fabric. I have enclosed a few pictures of the dress this dress. You will see the difference between the dress in their website and the dress they sell to me. They don't sell the same dress as what it appeared in the picture. But instead, they made a copy cat of the dress but made of very cheap fabric\/textile. And for me, this is plain cheating!<br \/><br \/>PLEASE DO NOT BUY Or even take a risk to buy this dress. Even if this dress is less than 20 bucks. But if thousands or millions of costumers bought this and became unhappy. It will make the crocodiles become filthy rich by selling junk items. Do not waste your dollar for dishonest people. And more so stress your self by being disappointed or angry. It's not worth it to get wrinkles out of this garbage!<br \/><br \/>I wanted to post a couple of pictures as proof.  But I didn't know why it was not working. I will try again later!

Comparing to Merino Kids sleep sack, we now like Woolino better in that: 1) woolino is thicker 2) Woolino has two way zipper. When it is closed, you can open sleep sack either from bottom or from side. Merino sleep sack (toddler size, 2011 style) has one way zipper. 3) Woolino toddler sleep sack we received now does not have opening for car seat safety belt, which I think useless for a toddler.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I was hesitant to order this gown sight unseen but after seeing it on several websites one of which had a video of it, I decided to make the purchase. I wanted a gown for my son's baptism and nowadays those are quite difficult to find! Most gowns are frilly with puffy sleeves and lots of embellishments. I was looking for a gown that was not bright white or shiny but one with a more simple and clean lined look. This is not easy to find for under $100!<br \/><br \/>This gown seemed to be a great look at a great price and when it arrived I was not disappointed. It is off white (not as creamy looking as ivory) with a textured raw silk look. It has a pearl-like sheen to it in the light and comes with 2 bonnets as described. Per some other reviews there are a couple of loose threads but overall the quality is excellent for the price and the threads can be easily snipped without ruining the gown.<br \/><br \/>The gown just fits our son and is a bit snug in the shoulders. If our event wasn't within a few weeks of receiving the gown I would have exchanged it for a larger size. If your baby is on the chunkier side I would definitely go up a size. Lengthwise the gown fits well past the feet and the material falls nicely.<br \/><br \/>The boy's bonnet fits well and looks cute and has a tie to fasten it around your child's head securely under the chin. It doesn't seem to slip off. The quality is the same as the gown. I cannot review the girl's bonnet except to say it has a frilly piece and is different enough from the boy's that it adds a more feminine look to the gown and makes this a true bargain if you plan on using it more than once.<br \/><br \/>I am so pleased with this purchase however I do wish it had come with a protective cover or garment bag. It was shipped in just a plastic sleeve and I will need to purchase something to store it in to protect it from dust, etc. This is not that big of a deal just something to be aware of if you don't plan on using it right away.<br \/><br \/>Overall, an excellent high quality item especially in consideration of the price! Highly recommended if you like a clean lined look or are looking for a gown for a boy or a &#34;family&#34; gown that is not embellished with lace, ribbons or embroidery."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The quality is about what I expected for the price point.  I have to mend one of the seams after the second wearing because it was stitched to close to the edge of the lace (common manufacturing defect).  Not a big deal, totally fixable with a few stitches.  I'm right between straight and plus sizes, depending on the garment, so it also fits as expected: a little big on the smallest hook.  I'd say it accommodates measurements between ~38&#34; and ~45&#34;.<br \/><br \/>Positive:<br \/>The garters themselves are nice and long, so I can wear the stockings lower (closer to the knee) than with another garter belt I have.  They adjust quite a bit so I could wear them higher if I wanted.<br \/><br \/>Negative:<br \/>The clips are on the flimsy side.  The plastic &#34;eye&#34; part of the clip is too bendy and so it doesn't grip as well as another garter I have with metal eyes.  After at least a half hour of struggle and multiple attempts, I gave up on trying to wear them with a pair of stockings that is a little thick on top (possibly not meant to be worn with garters): http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Opaque-Thigh-Highs-Satin-Accent\/dp\/B00G1RPM86\/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1416770935&sr=8-2&keywords=stocking+black+white+bow+leg+avenue<br \/>I have been able to wear them with raw-finish fishnets where I can just thread the clip through the netting.<br \/><br \/>I will keep looking for something sturdier with long garters."}

The material used is not very soft, and has limited stretch to it.  I typically wear a medium, sometimes a large and these one size panties are a very snug fit.  They have very little stretch to them so the beginning size seems it could be too large for somebody small or extra small.  If you wear a medium, or teeter between small and medium these should fit okay.  Low price, but I think you can find better in person at the store for the same price."}

Thankfully, Halo offers a full line of baby clothes in a polyester that is breathable and soft.<br \/><br \/>This specific coverall has a very nice zipper that zips from top-to-bottom which means the zipper won't cause discomfort around the neck area.

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"I ordered this dress in white and it definitely has a few major problems. First of all the fabric is so thin that it is completely see through, so in order to wear it you definitely have to wear something under it. Also the description says that it is \\\\\"slimming\\\\\" but once again, since it is so thin it shows off every single flaw you have. I only weigh 105lbs and the dress makes me look like I need to lose 10lbs. In order for the dress to look good I think I'm going to have to buy a tan spanx-type undergarment that takes care of the see through problem and the slimming issue."}

So I tried a size 12 and they are perfect.  Regular 14 jeans still fit, but these jeans are slightly stretchy and are very, very comfortable.  So you may want to try a size smaller than normal.  At least that's how it worked for me."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I love the colors--I bought 5 of them.  The fit is nice--not too tight but not sloppy either.  The shelf bra works like it is supposed to but it won't provide much support. The material is thin but for summer its thick enough not to show thru. I'll be able to wear this under another shirt or blouse and not feel too hot. Nice long length that will stay tucked in if you want to wear it that way. The hem has stray threads hanging from it, but I have scissors.  I had read the reviews that said that the straps were thin.  They weren't kidding--the straps are barely 1\/4 inch elastic dyed to match, attached to the cami with a plastic ring on the front.  The adjustable slide is also plastic. I would have preferred more substantial straps. I don't know how they will stand up to use and haven't washed them yet.  I'll keep them but won't buy anymore."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Really nice product.  Well made and fits perfectly.  I need a light capri that will dry quickly (since I have to wade in the water to get in the boat).

The real win here is; I'm a little hard to fit and this is the easiest way to shop.  Unless I get pants tailored, I can't walk into a Macys or Dillards or whatever and walk out with the pants in the color size and style that I want.  Jeans maybe, but not pants.

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Stumbled upon this jacket because it was on sale and I needed a new winter jacket anyway. Definitely a warm jacket and fits well (so be aware that you should consider getting a smaller size than usual).<br \/>Only negative point is that it generates a lot of static energy when combined with cashmere sweaters."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Super cute and a nice length for my 6 year old. Usually shorts sold for her age are SUPER short. These were great!"}

Not the fish-fur of the russian police, this is soft, clean, warm material. The ear flaps make an iceberg into an oven, and they tie up nicely. I use it whenever it's cold, but also whenever i play Metro: Last Light, watch Anastasia, read Superman: Red Son, shoot my Mosin Nagant, or drink Grey Goose.<br \/><br \/>One con you might consider? The lace that ties the flaps up is fragile. I replaced it with gutted paracord and never had a problem since."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Great beach wear.  The light on tone plaid design gives the pant a little more flare than standard light weight cotton or linen pants and allows these to be dressed down as shown in the product picture or up by adding loafers and a light weight sport coat.  Material is light weight but sturdy.  The pants are unlined, of course, but maintain structure adequately.  I wear a size 44 waist pant.  The size xxx large fit a little too baggy.  The XX may have fit better but I usually have to wear a size up to fit in the thighs and seat, so I will keep this size. I am 5' 9 and wear a 31 in inseam.  These ran longer that my length but not by much.  If you wear a 34 inseam of longer. these will probably be short on you."}

It was \\\\\"shedding\\\\\" a bit, but if worn occasionally it should be fine.  For everday use, I don't think it will last a few months.<br \/>- The wig is made of silky fibers and fits well.  It is spaced a bit too much in the back and will show if you have dark hair.  I suppose you can style it (cut & use hair wax) with a flat iron on very low temperature on it, but I would not recommend it because the fibers may be too sensitive and dull\/melt.<br \/>- For the price (30 bucks), I expected a slightly better quality.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I looked for a while to get a set of decent collar stays to replace the flimsy plastic ones that come with my shirts.  Between several department stores and the selection online, I have found these to be the best.  I purchased these titanium stays along with another bundle of stainless stays from another company; there is no comparison.  The Stiff Stays are of superior quality.  I am confident these will keep my collars looking presentable for a long time.  Some people were a little confused when I told them I was searching for collar stays, but these really do make a difference.  If neatness and detail are a priority, this is a wise purchase.  I was a little hesitant since these only came in two sizes, but I have found they are more than suitable for all of my shirts.  Even with the shirts that use a wider stay, these work fine (since they are so sturdy, they do not shift around and make a nice, solid point).  I opted for this over the magnetic type stays (those that have a backing to go on the inside of the shirt) because these are much less cumbersome when getting dressed and my collar does not really move off-center (perhaps this has to do with the shirt collar and construction, but for me the magnets seemed unnecessary).  The price is excellent, I looked at sets ranging well over $100 but could not justify the cost, as these are just as well made (to some, having solid silver monogrammed stays is a nice touch, but as far as practicality goes these are tops).  Finally, the storage vial is convenient and helps them from getting lost.  Highly recommended for anyone who wears dress shirts and cannot tolerate a curled collar."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"As my friend said, this is &#34;the ball gown of bras.&#34; It's incredibly soft and well made. I checked the stitching when I recieved it, and it's very high quality. It looks great on, and I feel pretty in it. It does not have lift inserts but lifts well with the underwire, which is comfortable. I used to buy VS bras, but they're so expensive and I feel like the quality has gone down. I feel like this is an above VS quality bra for a fraction of the price.

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I was hesitant to order this as I find buying clothes online to be hit or miss, but when the price dropped to about $15 shipped I figured it was worth the risk.  This hoodie is nice and soft and made from a fairly light\/thin cotton, but it seems well made.  I was worried about the size as at about 5' 10&#34; 180 lbs I can wear either Medium or Large depending on the cut and even XL if the product shrinks in the wash.  The Large fit me decently; it's big enough without being overly baggy.  The length is a bit long which makes it loose around the waist, but not bad.  The sleeves are more than long enough, but a bit tight in the biceps.  It's like the arms are fitted, but the body isn't.  I washed it once and it didn't seem to shrink.  I wore it all week while traveling and was very happy with it."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"My measurements are 38-34-48, my bra size is 34 DD. I would describe my figure as pear shaped, I don't carry much weight in the stomach, it's all in my hips and thighs. I usually wear swim leggings but I wanted to get a swimsuit for wearing to the hot tub and for just wading in the pool. This swimsuit fits the bill perfectly. I ordered the 5x expecting it to be a little big in the bust and it is. The cups don't really fit me perfectly, they aren't quite wide enough and a little tall and full, but they are very rigidly shaped so it's not obvious I'm not filling them out completely. The top circumference of the 5x is a little too loose for me, but again I expected this, and need to take it in a little. I wish there'd been been some kind of adjustment possible on the top part. The suit fits perfectly in the hips and I love the lower leg, it looks very flattering with my chubby legs. I am not a huge fan of the halter and have thought of modifying it to be straps instead, however it stays on well and I haven't had any issues with anything falling out. The color is a nice light blue although the white lining in the front makes the blue seem bluer and the back has a slightly yellow tint after I've worn it at the pool several times. The front of the suit has a white mesh lining that conforms with your body shape and the shirring over top hides any flaws. It's really nice actually!<br \/><br \/>The reason I'm docking 2 stars is despite the adorable factor, this swimsuit is not well made and the fabric is poor quality. I've not washed mine yet, and worn it about 6 times. When I do wash it, I'll handwash. The bra wires are already poking out and several seams have started coming loose. The area where the bra is sewn in is coming undone on both sides. The shirring in the front had tail threads and is also starting to come undone. These are things I can easily fix myself, but ideally I'd like to not have to. As well, the fabric already has some puckering on the bottom where I've sat on rough concrete in the hot tub.<br \/><br \/>I'm tempted to order a second one because they are so cute, but be prepared to do some repairs and don't go swimming without a sewing kit! Also be sure to only handwash, this suit is really delicate.at on rough concrete in the hot tub.<br \/><br \/>I'm tempted to order a second one because they are so cute, but be prepared to do some repairs and don't go swimming without a sewing kit!

I figured that they'd be low enough not to show over my jeans, but not so low that they wouldn't cover my whole rear. I bought two packages and tried them on once, and it was too much of a hassle to return them, so I just donated the unworn pairs to Goodwill. :("}

The core of the shirt and the ends of the sleeves are made of a soft, comfortable, t-shirt like material, while the bow and sleeves seem to be made of a thick satin. For layering purposes, it works wonderfully. If you want to wear it alone, however, you may not like how the two materials look together in different lights.<br \/><br \/>I was skeptical on how it would fit as the measurement chart had me worried it would be tight around the shoulders, but a medium actually fit very well when the large seemed like it would fit better based on numbers. The shirt is also long and fits well against the skin, which means it sits comfortably under a pencil skirt. I just wish it came in more colors!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"These shorts are OK, no better or worse. They are comfortable but a little tighter around the legs than my last pair (which I still have and wear).

The wash of the \\\\\"jeans\\\\\" is nice and consistent and dark.  The pockets are functional and the jeans are evenly proportioned and not too high rise.  I am 5ft 8in and the length was appropriate.  I would recomend wearing a longer shirt with the jeans to hide the fact that they are pull on pants.  They don't look as nice as real jeans, but I didn't expect that they would.  They met my expectations for this novelty product."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It is my firm belief that you can never have too many flowy vneck &#34;sweaters&#34;. As such, when I saw this one I instantly wanted it. I have purchased from this company before and have always been happy with my items. I read the reviews and found that most mentioned how short this shirt was. I purchased it mainly to wear with high waist shorts, but I still didn't want to look like I shopped at babygap. So, I sized up and got a medium. I wore it for the first time today, and it is perfect. Sizing up gave it some extra flow, and the perfect length. This sweater will look great with skinny jeans and boots, or high waist shorts, but I would not recommend wearing it with a flowy bottom unless you want to look like a bag lady. Shipping was fast and the shirt was well packaged. One thing of note, if you are looking for a warm sweater, keep looking. The shirt is soft and light, which is great as long as you are not wearing it for warmth. For reference, I am 5'2 and 125 lbs and the shirt hits me right at the top of my hips with my arms at my sides. With my arms raised it hits just under my ribcage, so tall girls beware. All in all I love it and I'm very happy with my purchase."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"I've written this review to bring to light a very serious problem for millions of plus sized women that exists because manufacturers<br \/>insist on trimming costs while upping prices to pay their executives, willy nilly, and without regard for what millions of plus sized women need or actually want. Instead of being able to focus on the face or decorations on the garment, our eyes are attracted to the model's sheer armsleeve with her arm condition showing. That's fine for her as she has muscle and her arm is lean. But Ulla Popken is to market to overweight women who wear plus sizes, some of which are huge, and nothing is more frustrating than seeing a beautiful outfit yet knowing it will look horrible on because of sheer sleeves. Unfortunately nearly all really pretty outfits on the site this year had sheer sleeves but that is true of other women's large size clothing sites as well. So more of you who share this concern need to speak up, please, to get manufacturers to put linings in sleeves for the millions of us who need them and want them and make fewer, although some, sleeveless items for the leaner and meaner--please. I didn't rate the fit because to me that distracts from the main issue--the sleeve."}

For my first bra, I was professionally fitted and ended up with a 38DD, although my ribcage is not that large.  It fits well and is very comfortable and holds the shields in place without any issue.  I do have the two part shields, so they're easy to use.    This is one of my favorite nursing bras, but I'm thinking the size of your breasts may affect how much you like it."}

I wear these for work with a button down shirt and tie. While they are probably designed as work pants, they do very well for a contemporary dressy look. I'm on the heavy side and find these are very roomy. The tailor actually charged me extra for these pants, she said that the seams were triple sewn(or something like that).     I've had these for around 6 months and they've held up very well. I send them to the dry-cleaner and so far minimal fading."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"The fabric is thin and cheap -- which would be fine for the price, but the design has a fundamental flaw: there is no zipper.  The only way to put on the costume is to slide it over your head.  While the bodice has some stretch to it, the waistline seam does not.  If your bust size is over a b-cup, you will not be able get the waist of the dress past your chest.  It's a shame.  The simple addition of a zipper, laces, velcro strips, or even just elasticizing the waistband would have made this costume perfectly acceptable."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I had never considered wearing silk long underwear as a guy until I had to wear a Nomex jumpsuit for work. Being fire retardant, the Nomex strongly recommended using only natural fibers as undergarments as nylons would likely melt to your skin should the Nomex be subjected to flame. So that leaves wool, silk and cotton.<br \/><br \/>I was pleasantly surprised at how *comfortable* the silk is. It's also a good weight if one is both inside, like at an office, and outside for work. It's not so heavy as to make me roast when inside, and silk seems to wick away moisture well. The legs fit fairly snug, and other layers can easily slide over them.<br \/><br \/>I'd recommend the dark colors. I had one pair of white. I realize they are worn under one's clothes and not seen, but the white are somewhat sheer. Seeing one's leg hair smashed flat through the white legging was unpleasant. Go with the dark color.<br \/><br \/>It is a delicate material, so mine wore some holes after about a season. Might get two seasons at the most. And it is silk, guys, so wash on gentle cycle, and line dry."}

She put it on as soon as it arrived and wore it to bed, it was so comfy.  She loves the little thumbholes on the sleeves.  She's worn them more often as pajamas than long johns, so I can't speak to the warmth factor as much, but I would recommend them overall."}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"The dress itself is cute but it is NOT one size fits all.  I am 5'6, ~140 lbs, usually size 10-12.  The top was extremely tight and the skirt hit at my knee, not calf.  It says it fits up to size 16 but Im not sure if they are using a different scale (children?)  I ordered another dress from them (different style), fit better but still tight as a L\/XL.  I know I need to lose a few pounds but I am by no means overweight.  If you are built like the model I think the dress will look great.  If you are built like an average women (not even large) then you may be disappointed."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I bought the largest size of this top after searching for women's sizes. They run small. I  expected more flow and room in the chest for the XXXL, but the top hugs pretty snug. It also is snug over the booty, but still wearable. My chest is larger than average and so are my hips. The shape of the top makes it work but if you prefer a more flowing relaxed fit, try a different maker. The color is rich, the fabric very soft. I suspect the patterns are cut for less generous proportions."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I like this dress and this brand. The dress is hip, good for work, and a good deal. The material is thin but the dress is still flattering (and I am curvier than usual right now....). This dress was just too big for me. It is going back and I will wait to see if the smaller size (M or S) comes back in stock."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"CAUTION: Described waist sizes are &#34;tight&#34; compared to other manufacturers.  On the pre-washed jeans a 36 waist is actually a 35.<br \/>A 38 waist is actually a 37.<br \/>Described lengths actually vary by as much as 2 inches up or down."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I've been very impressed by everything I've gotten from BB Dakota, and this top is no exception! A great deal, and a great top.<br \/>Fits loosely, as depicted; I'm a size ten or twelve American, and the large fits perfectly. The elastic around the waist keeps you from looking like you're wearing a rice sack, though, and the waist hits low enough that you don't look pregnant.<br \/>It's definitely 100% polyester, as stated, so if you're a smoker, be advised: you are highly flammable in this top, if wrinkle and stretch free.<br \/>Also, please note that it is more of a standard primary-color yellow than pale yellow like in the picture.<br \/>I adore it!!! Fun and pretty, and elegant even if you're wearing jeans and sneakers with it!"}

It is hardly water resistant, and definitely NOT waterproof. The back vent across the shoulders allows cold gusts and water IN defeating the entire purpose, plus with no &#34;pit zips&#34; for underarm ventilation expect to be both too hot, too cold and VERY moist in this jacket. I choose this as a last minute buy for a springtime trip to Seattle. I liked that it was a light weight option, good for layering in a drafty and occasionally drizzly area, and less pricey then other brands however I would spring for a better brand like Patagonia's waterproof shell if I needed to another in the future."}

I can wear them to yoga (were I get nothing but envious admiration for these and the other colors and patterns, which I also bought), but I have to wear a pair of panties under them to increase their opacity.<br \/>Also, if the makers of these leggins read this, they should always sew them with a little diamond insert in the crotch area, which would increase their &#34;strechability&#34;."}

I don't know what that is, but the important part is that it is a 'breathable' fabric. I can't wear synthetic fabrics because they don't breath and i feel like my skin is sufficating. I know. Weird, unless you are like me, then you understand why i look up fabrics that i don't recognise as 'natural'. Anyway, the tunic color is just as it is pictured; a vibrant red. VERY red. Lovely; and slinky! It is quite long and if you are 5'5&#34; like i am, you could actually wear it as a dress! I probably won't wear it outside because i'd have to wear a Spanx or something like it because it will show tummy rolls. I decided to keep it as a nightie and something to wear after a shower. It really is a sexy little thing and i like it so much that i ordered another one is Royal Blue. FYI: i'm 5'5&#34; 200 pounds and size 20\/22 fits perfectly. I think you'll like this one."}

I'm a size 7 with long arms and they all had nice, long sleeves you can fold up. However, the thermal variety feel a bit tighter than the regular style, so keep this in mind if you're wavering between sizes. I'm worried that if I dry this in the dryer that it will shrink too much, but the regular versions should be fine. I especially like the long sleeves and comfy V-neck, so if you don't like feeling clothing up near your neck in front, these tees are great, but not too deep plunging."}

He said the gloves might not stretch that much due to the rabbit fur lining.  Fortunately, they fit nicely and I wouldn't want them any bigger.

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I was very excited to get my business cat t-shirt.  I am a cat lover by nature and so all things cat related get me excited to the point where one might thing someone had sprinkled cat nip close by.  There were a few concerns with the cat shirt, however.  First, it was much bigger than the size would have you believe.  I ordered an XXL because I am a somewhat robust cat lover, and yet it was hanging off of me and sagging in what I could only describe as the wrong places.  I looked like I was hiding a cat under my shirt.  Then, the color was much darker than the light blue in the picture would have you believe.  And, the shirt itself was very long.  This is great if you have a long torso and I do.  But even for me, it was still long.  It hung down to almost my hip area accentuating areas that frankly need no further attention. It made me want to cry into my saucer of milk.  Then, after washing the shirt one time the cool black cat with the tie already looked somewhat faded.  Leaving me feeling apprehensive about the long term prospect for my business cat.  Hopefully he really does have nine lives."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I live in Japan, and I wanted to give my mother a yukata style robe for Christmas.  I ordered one before I left Japan (not really having time to hop out to the store).  Unfortunately, it was on backorder for so long that, in the end, it wouldn't come in until February.  So I ordered this in the place, thinking that I looked beautiful and traditional from the picture and the descriptions.<br \/>It is beautiful, and the material is soft and lovely.  Unfortunately, it's nothing like the yukata style robe I was hoping for.  It really felt like something made for Americans trying to look Japanese.<br \/>Even though it was made in Japan.<br \/>It's nice, but it's not what I was looking for, and if you're hoping for something that seems REALLY traditional, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fits as expected, hits the legs about the same place as in the picture. Very comfortable, dries quickly. One thing that wasn't clear before purchasing was whether or not it has a mesh brief inside, and it it does. Its also side pockets on either side, a back pocket, and a &#34;hidden&#34; pocket on the inside front right of the trunks that is maybe 4x2.5&#34; and particularly useful for locker keys and IDs."}

The colors are very bright, but the blue is not as bright as I expected but still looks great! I was very nervous about the sizing. I am usually a 32B-32C and a 0-2 in pants so I ordered a small. The bottoms show a little more cheek than most bottoms I've had but not anything too much! The top fits great, but if you're looking for a top that will show cleavage then this isn't the top for you! Overall, I really like it and think it's very cute and it's waaaaay better than buying the $90 Triangl bathing suit when this one looks almost identical! I recommend this bathing suit for anyone whose looking for a cheap alternative to the Triangl bathing suit! :)"}

Not for a slightly larger girl."}

Otherwise they worked great for her soccer season AND they won the state championship."}

I read through all the reviews and everyone said the M\/L was WAY too big. But I thought I'm a size 8, there's no way I could fit in an XS\/S. I'm 5'6 145lbs.. wide hips. People were saying they were a size 2 and the XS\/S fit prefect. So there's no way I'm gonna get my size 8 butt in a size 2 dress, right? WRONG! I got it in and it was just right! I was so relieved (and pretty ecstatic to be back in an XS) The dress is short, but it's Halloween. It's supposed to be. I wore silk black shorts under it so nothing showed with a pair of tights. The tassles go all around the dress. I'm a C cup and the chest fit perfect. I had room for the ladies, and it wasn't trashy or low cut. The gold lining was really cute. Very nice comfortable material.<br \/><br \/> Honestly, I couldn't have been happier with this purchase. I hope this helps anyone of the fence of buying this, JUST DO IT! I got compliments all night. I'm 27 and this was definitely my favorite Halloween costume I've ever had."}

Although it is designed to keep one's nipples from being visible, its purpose is ultimately defeated as it comes up higher on the body and raises clothing so that one can see an outline of the petal.<br \/><br \/>On the plus side, it is durable and packs well.

Yes it's not heavy material, but it's summer and if you have to wear a suit, the light weight will be appreciated.  The fit was right on and at this price, if there's a rip or tear, it doesn't break my heart or my billfold to just replace it... and that happens more often than I like, where I work.

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"It's a great wallet, can fit a lot of cards and will still be very thin. Maybe the only problem is that if feels like it has a very soft material and sometime I'm worried that if I don't save it properly in my pocket it will get damage with time."}

One problem I do have with it is that when ordering it, it shows a piture of the hat containing mittens with a paw print on the bottom side of the mittens. This hat did not have that. The mittens were plain white which I think really takes away the novelty and cuteness of the item. My daughter was upset about this as well. I think if the picture is on the site showing it, it should have it!"}

Well-done."}

We curvy girls usually have two choices - too tight in the legs\/waist or saggy\/baggy panties that always ride up or down.  If that is you, then you have to try these.  After trying 10 different brands\/styles, I finally tried my first pair of Bali Women's Fit Your Curves. I literally couldn't believe it.  They fit snug but not binding.  The waist has give, but retains its shape.  The panties STAY PUT.  I actually forget I'm wearing them, which is how undergarments are supposed to be, right?  The cotton breathes beautifully and feels soft and luxurious.  They definitely feel more expensive.  Price aside, I would have paid much more for this kind of fit.  So to sum up - if you've got lovely lady curves, you'll love the fit, feel and quality."}

I never cared for visors but this is soft and cushioned around the forehead and I can leave it loose enough that I don't even feel it. The wide brim truly shelters from the sun. So I have the protection of a large sun hat without the heat being trapped in the actual hat. No sweating in this hat, even in the blazing sun. I've stopped wearing sunglasses as much so that is another plus for comfort. When I want to take it off (no hat band look left on the hair), I can simply hook it around a purse strap, backpack, belt loop, etc. I ordered white because I wanted it to reflect the sun and it does so very well. Yes, it is unfortunately made in China. But it is cotton and at least in white, it had no horrid chemical smell, no offgassing.  **The bow is removed easily with one tiny snip."}

They seem a little thin and low tech, but they are fine for our purposes (only about 5 snow days a year)."}

They kind of remind me of cheap children's pjs or something. They stretch, but don't go back to their original size. I definitely move around a lot and sit in lots of strange position... but still... go for something different. These are pretty crappy. I also bought the seamless hipsters three pack and the two pack of Hanes cotton boyshorts and they are totally different and super awesome. I just ordered some more!"}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Cost vs. quality...I have to say cost wins! I expected a higher quality of nylon material for what these gowns cost, I would have to say judging by how thin this material actually is, the cheapest nylon was used to make these gowns. Also, the skirt is not as full as it looks online, and it is not 54\\\\\" long, as I am only 5'2\\\\\" & the gown & coat barely reach my ankles. As short as I am I expected this to reach the floor, at least it did when I measured myself before placing my order. The sleeves on the coat are too short and the darts for the fit of the bodice point outward rather than fitting snugly across the chest. If I were you I would think twice about wasting your hard earned money on these gowns, I plan on returning mine. When I spend $121 for 1 set & an extra gown I expect higher quality & a better fit!"}

The leaves on the green and black dress are  a batik pattern outlined with simple embroidery.  The fabric is part cotton (cotton blend) and feels soft and comfortable.  The cap elasticized sleeves are modest for those situations in which a sleeveless dress is not really appropriate or optimal and yet still cute.  But, they would be more comfortable if they were a bit looser.  I am about 5'6&#34; and found the length of the dress to be perfect, long enough to be truly maxi in flats and not so long that I worry about walking on the dress or tripping on it."}

Given that, they seemed to run a bit small compared to other brands, but I allowed for that by purchasing the size 4T.  All the images were good, as compared to some other selections that have just images of wheels on them."}

I know that they are supposed to fit-but not be tight since they are diapers, however, this is way small.

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I purchased this dress for a friend who wears a size 2 at Torrid. It is made from a synthetic jersey-type material that stretches, so do not get it form-fitting. The 1\/2 sleeves made of chiffon do not appear to be delicate and sheer unless one lifts their arm to swirl the fabric or draw attention to it. We plan to use an empire belt with the dress it to give it a bit more style. This dress fit just right. It is colorful and looks busier than in the photo, which seems to emphasize the black on it, but my friend thinks that she will wear it - if only on Halloween!"}

The flower is outlined in silver tinsel like thread that falls out like hair.<br \/>3. A clear &#34;thread&#34; hung from the neck area. So I pulled it and it kept coming and coming.

Size tag with washing instructions and price tag are all 100% in chinese.<br \/>Theres NO WAY to know what was used in making that dress but I'm 95% positive it wouldn't pass our safety regulations for our babies in America.

The elastic, the part that gives the illusion of &#34;slimming&#34; does not hug the way it's supposed to, and the fabric under the elastic does not drape like the picture would indicate.

I am 5'7 128 and I ordered the 8\/10 and it fit perfect.<br \/><br \/>I have long legs so I am having the dress shortened to thigh length because I have a long stride.  Dress falls at my knees so I have a difficult time walking but most people would be fine with it, I believe.  In my opinion, spending $ 20 for alterations is still worth it for the dress.  Nice purchase, shipping took about 3 weeks or less."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I am very pleased. These bras are very comfortable and fit well. It is hard to find bras for the smaller chested woman, but these are great. I like the fact that even when you are nursing the under panel goes on both sides if your breast..it provides a little more coverage and keeps the shoulder strap from falling down. The only negative, and this is minor, is the seam that runs straight across the middle makes for kind of a weird shape.<br \/>But let's just be honest about one thing...the red on the inside is just because it is fun, not to &#34;stimulate the baby&#34; like some have claimed; when they ate nursing it is under their chin so they can't see it anyway!"}

I don't know if this will continue to be an issue if I simply cut my hair (which I need to do anyway) and I would rather it be a little snug than have it fall off every time the wind blows.  If I went up a size, it would be too big to stay on when it's a little breezy.<br \/><br \/>Packaging and shipping were great.

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"After reading reviews that already warned of sizing issues, I took a gamble b\/c I wanted the shirt bad enough.....my mistake.  I returned it.  Turns out the disclaimer about sizes running small is not enough.  I usually wear a medium (definitely would not have fit), but went with an XL b\/c of the prior reviews and the disclaimer.  The XL width was about what a medium width should've been, but the sleeves were still too short and the width was too long (although true to an XL length).  So basically it's both too small and too big.<br \/><br \/>If you get the sleeveless version and go 1-2 sizes up then that's one less issue I guess, as long as you don't mind a longer length; or if you're a girl and like tight shirts then maybe you'll like that version.<br \/><br \/>Dang it, I really wanted to rock some VSW!

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I am a busty girl and I am tall. I also consider my tummy a problem area. But I fell in love with this dress. I know buying dresses online is a gamble. This dress so great. It is so forgiving. It flatters all of my curves and nice areas and then hides the bad areas. The material is nice. The items got here much faster then the shipping suggested. I live in the USA and this came to me from the UK. Just follow the sizing charts. I wore this to the office and it worked awesome! The buttons on the front were a tad lose but I can easily fix that. And the buttons are just for show so it doesn't really matter. This is the best that a dress has looked on me in a long time. I love love love love it! Thanks!"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Not at all what I imagined it would be.  The material was thin and rough, and there was very little craftmanship in the design.  Poorly put together.  Returned immediately."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Only thing I do not like is that the knit cuffs tend to pill. Otherwise, comfortable, washes well. Nice to be able to push the sleeves up, have the sleeves stay in place."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I purchased these because I am a belly dancer and for our costumes we typically need some serious cleavage. However, this is only really good if you want your cup to look a little fuller, it won't add any real cleavage and the cup enhancement is very subtle. You will probably be the only one to notice any difference. Also, they are a bit harder than I anticipated, so there is a difference when you go in for a hug, again though, probably only you will feel it. I think these are good if you have a bra where the cup doesn't quite fit, but if you are looking for a more extreme enhancement then keep looking."}

The shirts run small plus when I received mine there was a hole in one of the seams so I contacted them wanting to replace it and they refused too so I asked for my money back and they again to refused doing that as well. Nothing but a waste of money."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Boyfriend loves it but I wasn't expecting to have to lace it up myself. There wasn't instructions provided so I came back to the picture and used that for a guideline. I ended up with the medium but it's stretchy and looks pretty hot anyway."}

Although when you get down to the actual product you spent money on its lacking. it feels VERY flimsy and I dont suspect it to hold up for long. It is a canvas Wallet with a sheet of carbon fiber on the top. And for the seam it is just a &#34;Permanent Tape&#34; -Their words. It holds up to five cards just fine I wouldnt stuff any more in. and look great if you dont touch it. Although I wont be returning it because of the hassle and part laziness. I will  use the wallet until it starts to fall apart and look for something similar.<br \/>Short Hand,<br \/>Okay, not worth the price tag. Would not purchase again."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I like the material and the color. They seem fairly sturdy. I just can't seem to get the right size. One size down was a little small, and this size was a little big. A little big is better than a little small though."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"fits everything I would need to travel. aside from the handles, it looks like it could be a unisex bag. Nice lined pockets for electronic devices. I use this for travel a lot because its a pretty big bag. The one thing that I do not like is that after I stuff this thing full of clothes and makeup it weighs A TON! Granted, its my fault for packing it but still, I find it gets heavy quickly. Luckily it has a giant shoulder strap so I can lug it around. haha."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It's Texas.  What more do you need to say?"}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Waist of money. False advertisement. Wouldn't recommend ordering this at all. Very disappointed."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Very nice looking, but the fabric is stiffer than expected for something designed for active wear. D3finitely runs smaller in size. The neck was too binding, and I'm short on time, so I hacked it off. I recommend buying it one size larger than you think you need."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love these pants to practice yoga in!  Perfect fit and stay in place, plus they are fun and colorful.  Only tricky part was finding a top to match but got it!  There is no black in the pants and you might expect (I did) from the photo.  Perivinkle colored top looks nice with these pants."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"More like a tank top. The lining underneath is too short and tight. I bought a size bigger to let it be flowy and it didn't fit in any way shape of form. Ended up giving it away to a friend. Such a waste of money"}

It accidentally bent when I put it in a bag, so make sure to keep it in a place where it won't get damaged. Nice quality. The ties are a bit too high, so the mask wouldn't sit correctly on my face, but instead would stick out on the bottom. I took off the ties, and moved them down to one of the holes closer to the middle, and then it fit perfectly."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Unflattering"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I'm still debating whether to hem it or return it.  I wanted to be able to wear it barefoot but it requires heels if I don't want to break my neck.  I'm 5'4&#34;.  If I were larger (not just taller) it probably would have fit better."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This wallet was exactly what I needed.  Every card fits and I don't have to carry two wallets.  The only issue i have and the reason for 4 out of 5 stars is the horrible smell.  It smells like it was dipped in gasoline and I can't figure out how to remove the smell.  It's overwhelming and I'm afraid I may have to stop using the wallet if it doesn't go away."}

I'm 5'7&#34; and the hem was about 2 inches off the ground when I put it on, so this might not be the best choice for a more petite person.  It looks pretty well made, so it will probably be able to be used for a few more Halloweens."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Although I love the color, this T-shirt is way too flimsy and so loose in the neckline that it falls over one shoulder. The fabric is too thin and sticks to my body -- it looks as if it was cut wrong. I cannot be seen in public with this on. It's not even comfortable enough to use as a night shirt. I have submitted a return request and am awaiting a response from the seller."}

I carry a personal phone and a work radio, glasses, fenix flashlight, clip knife, small first aid kit, three sets of keys, change, cash, work ID and a wallet every day. These pants are great and wear like iron. The last three pair of green rangers lasted about 18-22 months before a tear appeared ( in each pair) just above the seam that runs across the left thigh to the bellows pocket. The seam did not rip, the tear was above the seam stitching. I'm not complaining...18-22 months of hard use is awesome! Fit is good at waist and loose in the crotch and legs (36X32 is my regular size in Levi 517s also) , with good leg openings for work boots. I work with heavy equipment, so dirt, mud, grease ect , crawling under equipment, sitting, walking and squatting  is a usual day and takes a toll on pants. I have one pair of the tan, one pair of black for nites out on the town and the green and brown for work. Oh, the tan has a slight green tinge but they are tan still. So, the cargo pockets are deep and the flap has snaps (I like) not Velcro. The front pockets are deep and in 6 pair I have not had a front pocket get a hole in it.  Just bought three more pair so looks like I'm set until into 2015"}

I wear a US size 8-10, and according to the size chart, that would be an XL. I ordered a XXXL because so many reviews said I should size up by 2 sizes. It was approx 2 sizes too big. I suggest just looking at the US size comparisons and buy according to that. I'm 5'8&#34; and 170 pounds. I wear a 36C. I'm in the process of exchanging for the XL."}

Did not use the tie as it closes with Velcro and would look tacky with the shirt I wore. Didn\u2019t use the pocket thing. Cufflinks are large in length and look weird on the shirt.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"No more back fat or muffin top. I bought the tan large. I'm working getting rid of the muffin top and back fat. A little about my struggle: I think I have a curvy butt no thunder thighs though (I think I'm average, no one has ever accused me of being flat but I'm no KimK) I'm btwn and 10 & 12 in skinny jeans (gap, target, 7seven jeans) but the 12 just sag on my rear and legs and the 10's gives me a slight muffin top & I always have to tuck in my muffin top when I sit. I tuck this into my jeans and underwear, it never rolled! I wore this with a V-neck tshirt and I was smooth. No armpit fat trying to squish out. I was comfortable and I love how it improved my posture. I'm a 36\/38B size so this pushed my girls together to give me a more voluptuous appearance. Lastly, I developed GERD after pregnancy, when you eat with this thing on EAT LITE! Otherwise you will be hurting and taking the sucker off."}

I'm a volunteer EMT on the weekends and EMT student during the week. These pants survived less than one week in the field. The crotch split when I was kneeling down bed-side to get a BP and the right cargo pocket is just plain coming off. There are a handful of other stitches coming out at any given point, no matter how many I get with my lighter.     Fortunately they've accepted a return for these as defective. Kudos for good customer service, but beware. If you decide to get a pair, I hope they're better for you than they were for me.     P.S. All buttons on these pants are SNAPS, not button through an eye. The cargo pockets don't even have snaps or buttons, but are velcro. Go with Dickies."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"When those lazy Sundays come around, I grab my biggest t-shirt, comfiest sweatpants, and nearest sweatshirt. After receiving Alternative Apparel's unisex sweatshirt as a gift,  this lightweight cotton blend has quickly become my new staple for not just Sunday, but for all days of the week. Despite being washed, this sweatshirt (which can also be doubled as a sweater) keeps the super soft feel that makes it hard to take off. It's a combination of cotton, eco-friendliness and comfort and actually looks good; it's practically the Prius of clothes.   This sweatshirt is one of those versatile pieces of clothing that is compatible with any type of person. Hipster's can rock the \\\\\"I don't care but I actually do care what I wear\\\\\" type of look, eco activists can be proud to wear something so environmentally friendly  (according to their website, the sweatshirt is made up of 6.25% recycled polyester, 6.25% organic cotton, and 4%, naturally occurring rayon!), and for the more flamboyant type, the sweatshirt comes in an assortment of colors from \\\\\"eco-red\\\\\" to \\\\\"eco-royal.\\\\\" Although it's definitely pricier than most sweatshirts, it's a worthwhile investment thats snug enough for the chilly fall, yet light enough for the warm spring."}

Also, I bought the 3 month size for my daughter who is 4 months old and 44% in weight and 61% in height (she is usually a bit small for clothes her size).  They fit just right, but with only a bit of wiggle room.  According to the tag that came with the onesies, the sizing is as follows:  Preemie - 5 lbs, NB - 9 lbs, 3 months - 12 lbs, 6 months - 18 lbs, 9 months - 21 lbs, 12 months - 24 lbs, 18 months - 27 lbs, 24 months - 30 lbs."}

The fabric is 75% Polyester, and 25% rayon. Which means it's going to hug you in all the right places.<br \/><br \/>The waist band is elastic but a thicker band than other skirts that I've had. I actually prefer the longer waist bands that are elastic because it helps them to stay in place. I definitely do not want a skirt that I have to constantly keep pulling up or pulling down. It's annoying, and it's anything but attractive.<br \/><br \/>I like the length of the skirt, and it's really comfortable. And it looks really really good on! I got the size small and I am 5 foot 2 1\/2, and it's perfect. It's a great links and it's beautiful.

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I purchased these Viscose classic styled briefs as well as the micro modal bikini and brief styles from David Archy in a size Small to fit my 30-31 inch waist(I have an athletic build) and need more room and support for all day comfort.<br \/><br \/>I ordered these in a large as recommended(its the smallest size available), but like a previous poster mentioned they run a bit large compared to the other styles.  Specifically, the cut of the legs is slightly oversized and there is some extra material in the back. This leads to the underwear riding up slightly in the crack and gives a &#34;cheeky&#34; look and feel. This is made worse by moving around a lot, but may not happen much if you spend most of your time sitting.<br \/><br \/>The material is wonderfully soft and the waistband is a nice width and texture. I have found that the material shrinks slightly when run through the dryer on high heat.<br \/><br \/>Overall, these are very comfortable, but if you are between sizes you might want to size down. These don't have as much stretch as their micro modal lines, but do have enough give to accommodate you.<br \/><br \/>As these are priced at ~$2 a pair I'm not too dissapointed, but I'll probably not purchase anymore of this line until they match the sizing to their other styles."}

I\u2019m not sure why but  I have had this issue with other shape wear, it will compress my waist so well that my lower abdomen will kind of  pooch out I read someplace that only a corset would stop this but I\u2019m not a big fan of that look, I look fine standing but once I sit it\u2019s all downhill...I totally will keep this and will look for opportunities to wear it maybe some lower ab exercises?

It's VERY sturdy, and the fabric doesn't feel like it's about to rip apart, it's very strong and very well made. My only complaint is that the laces are kind of thin and flimsy, and I foresee replacing them in the future. Make sure before you order that you TAKE YOUR MEASUREMENTS!

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Ordered four pair of size 34X32.  One of them was a true 34X32, one was about a 34X30, and two of them were about a 32X32.  One out of four fit properly.<br \/><br \/>My first review is of the one pair that fit true to size.  I love them.  I wore Levis for 40 years but was absolutely sold on the Carhartts the first time I tried them.  Very comfortable, durable, and good looking.  I will continue to buy them as long as they make them.<br \/><br \/>My second review is of the provider, or quality control inspectors who allow 75% of their product to be shipped out to consumers in the incorrect size.  Not minor differences in sizing, but two full inches off of size.  This is a black eye for Amazon.  They are the ones who need to put a stop to this.<br \/><br \/>Lesson learned - Never buy these jeans from an online provider.  Go to the store and try on each and every pair so you don't get hosed.  Somewhat in Amazon's defense, they did allow free returns, but the time frame from original order to receipt of the proper sized product was close to three weeks."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Buying this would send the message to Ringlings that the way they treat their animals (aka abusing them) is OK. Is that the message we want to send to little girls across the world? Why not print a picture of an elephant enjoying freedom, enjoying the wild they belong in, on a tshirt. There are many alternative elephant presents that actually go to GOOD causes, rather than telling Ringlings to go ahead and continue beating their elephants."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fit as expected was the only good choice, even though this is not an item that you wear.  I don't like a huge purse, but prefer one that is a more moderate size.  The leather is also soft, not stiff.  I also like a purse that has sections so I can organize things and find them quickly.  This one satisfies the requirements for all my favorite features.

The so called women's medium is more like a child's medium.  The fabric is scratchy and see through.  A very cheaply made item and not suitable to wear - let alone give as a gift.  Very disappointing and I was too embarrassed by the quality to give it as a gift.  I am requesting a refund."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I like the soft cotton blended with lycra, and the cut. Received 3 bright solid colors: orange, blue and fuchsia, definitely not subtle colors. The lace is actually sewn on top of the panties. I was expecting the lace to extend at the top of the panties, creating a more delicate look."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I searched all over in stores and couldn't find a good sunhat for my two girls. I couldn't find any with good sun coverage, that didn't fall off or have thin material that would flap around in the breeze. Baseball hats were the only ones that stayed on well, but of course they don't cover the ears or neck. I am so glad I ordered these hats. They offer excellent sun protection and the brim is somewhat stiff so that it doesn't fold backwards in the wind, but the top is thin and airy to keep the head cool. The combination of the adjustable chin strap and the tightening strap in the back makes for a perfect fit and makes the sizes very forgiving. I bought a child size and a youth size and, although the youth is bigger, my 2 and 4 year olds can wear them pretty much interchangably. I was worried that these would look super dorky, but I was prepared to make them wear them anyway. They don't though, they're really cute. I got the primrose, its a nice pinkish\/lavender color and will go with almost all their clothes. I feel silly for being so excited about these hats but after searching every retail store in our area I feel so relieved to be able to take my kids out in the sun this summer and not have to worry. Remember, your kiddos skin should be especially protected at their young age. Say no to sunburns. :)"}

What I do like about it is that it has decent card space and it really made me realize that I don't need so much stuff in my wallet. Business cards are outdate. Next time someone hands you a business card, take a picture of it with your mobile phone and give it back. Despite the flaws, I do not regret purchasing this wallet."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I am an independent insurance adjuster who goes out to look at cars on a daily basis. Sometimes I will work in the streets or go to houses.  There have been a few times where a car almost hit me.  In New York City when its cloudy or raining you become invisible to cars by wearing dark clothing.  There have been other times where people approached me in a hostile manner wondering &#34;what I am doing&#34;.  I decided it was best to start wearing high visibility shirts and jackets during my work.  So I got this jacket in safety yellow\/lime-yellow along with some drywear polos which really did the trick.  When I go out to do my inspections no one ever questions me as I appear somewhat official.  When meeting with people, they recognize me from far away.  When working in the street, oncoming cars see me more easily.<br \/><br \/>At first, I had bought 2 safety orange and 2 safety yellow polos, but now have all safety yellow polos.  The safety orange is more visible then other colors, but in my opinion the safety yellow is the most visible.  The safety orange is a little more stylish in that you dont appear like the school crossing guard.  It looks more like a hunting jacket.  However, I prioritize safety over everything else so I chose the safety yellow.  The safety yellow also looks more official looking then the safety orange which is important because I dont want to be approached by someone who thinks I am up to no good.  When I was at the US Open I noticed the people in the crowd wearing safety yellow t-shirts could be spotted  from very far away.  The safety orange seemed a bit harder to see.<br \/><br \/>As for this jacket, let me make the following remarks:<br \/><br \/>-  The outside of the jacket is made of windproof cordura.  The inside has a thin cloth lining and the sleeves a polyester lining.  When you zip it all the way the color covers the entire neck and the lower part of the face.  There is a storm flap so when the wind blows it wont blow through the zipper.<br \/><br \/>-  There are two zippered inside pockets and two zippered outside pockets.  One inside pocket is so large I believe it could fit a full sized tablet.  This pocket utilizes the space between the outside cordura and inside cloth insulation.  The other inside pocket is large enough to fit a small tablet or large cellphone like the Note.  The two outside pockets are zippered.<br \/><br \/>-  The sleeves and bottom have are elastic which seals them up.<br \/><br \/>-  This is not a winter jacket, but more appropriate for Fall and Spring with temperatures in the 40s, 50s, 60s.<br \/><br \/>Overall an excellent jacket with a very durable and solid build."}

They are still water proof - milk, juice and water just run down the front and collect in the pocket.  Even though lots has gone down the bib, my baby's clothes are still dry.  The velcro is extra long instead of a stingy little square so it can be adjusted to fit small babies (mine is 6 months) or big ones.  They wash up quickly in the sink, rinsing out easily or can be thrown in the washer.  They air dry quickly... wash after breakfast, dry by lunch!  I love them and won't buy any others ever again."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I ordered this dress a size up (XL) when I normally wear a 10\/12 and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'5 and 36D so if you're about that size DO NOT order the LARGE. It WILL NOT fit you, unless you have no hips\/butt\/tummy.<br \/><br \/>I was immediately impressed with the quality of this costume; I had previously tried on similar flapper dresses at the Halloween store in town for twice the price and this one has some weight to it, I can see it lasting many years! It also looks fantastic once you start dancing, the fringe is so cool!<br \/><br \/>Definitely worth the price."}

We both enjoy our Vanity Fair Body Sleeks Age Defying Lift and that's the truth.  One other disclosure.  This is Judy writing.  John is playing with his mental blocks.  It's about time.<br \/><br \/>Seriously, this Vanity Fair is a well made and excellent bra for a reasonable price, especially for non-well endowed women.  It provides sufficient support and eliminates a whole bunch of juggle.  From past experiences with this brand and this particular model, the material is strong and resilient and repeated machine washings will work just fine."}

Instead I got this 2 coats for less money and they look nicer & are just as warm. I highly recommend these 2 coats. I'm usually a small, but I ordered a med & it fits perfectly. I made a mistake on the hooded down parker, I meant to order brown & ordered black by accident. I had no problem, called Amazon & they immediately got in touch with the company, & the problem was recitifed right away. The coats came well before the due date."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Ordered this product and the same in two other colors, black and navy.  While they will never pass for a high quality dress pant, they are a good everyday casual pant.  More of a work, uniform type.  Overall they are exactly what I needed for the purpose I planned:  behind the desk of a hotel.  Size and fit were correct. Overall worth the price paid.  Just wish Lee could produce their clothing in the USA.  But what is made in the USA clothing industry for the mid range shopper."}

When I slipped them on my big toe could poke out. I did not contact the vender for a refund or replacement, it was about a 1 inch hole, so I simply repaired it myself. it was a manucfaturing flaw.

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Recieved one (small) for Christmas, in fact my stepfather got them for all of us girls. I thought it was hokey since we live in Florida and it was 85 degrees that day as it is most days. Anyway, I'm 5'1 about 125-128lbs around the holidays. It fit was pretty good; a little baggy around the crotch and ankles (with the footies on) but this is good so that you can move about while lounging. The fabric is a little heavy for pajamas but excellent for keeping you warm and cozy. I had it on for an hour so that my stepfather could see that we loved his gift. I had to take it off as I was beginning to sweat. Not a reflection of the product; it's just usually pretty warm here. Now, that I see the cost on this; firstly unless he got a really good deal - not worth $80. And lastly, I feel like I should use it more often, if even with the zipper open so that I don't pass out."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"We wore these pants for my dance class, and we all loved them. The slit is sexy and it looks great while dancing. We would wear either spankies or leggings underneath them so we don't show too much skin. However, the size I ordered (a small I believe), was pretty big. I just pinned the waist and the openings for the feet and it was fine."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Decent quality for the price.  The material is thin which I like but if your an active swimmer these may wear out over time.  Also, somewhat of a loose fit.  Clings to the body but can be moved around easily.  Like the pouch in the front.  Comfortable."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Pretty sunhat! Has a drawstring inside to adjust the fit; has a nice burlap flower detail. It did come with a slightly creased brim, but I just took a damp towel, placed it between an iron on the highest setting, and moved in continuous circular motions until they came out. It takes some time, so be patient. I'm also keeping it hung in my closet until I'm ready to pack it so it doesn't get too many creases."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This dress looks exactly like the picture! I got the dress in 2 business days with regular shipping, which was very exciting! I plan on using them as bridesmaid dresses. It also comes with a shaw the same color and fabric as the dress. The sizing chart is a bit weird though. I ordered the dress for my largest bridesmaid to make sure it would fit. According to the size chart, her bust and waist were a bit to big for the 3x. However, I ordered anyway to see if it might fit b\/c I loved the dresses. It fits perfectly everywhere execpt the front bust. It is actually a bit big and will have to take in a little bit. I am very pleased with these dresses!!!"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Really adorable outfit and looked so cute on our 5 month old, but I ordered the small and it looks like it fits a 3 year old!  Manufacturer should really adjust the sizing on this or make another extra-small size.  The hat wouldn't stay on, kept falling over over his face, the booties could fit a 5 year old and the zipper is very short and doesn't really open up enough so it's hard to put on over his head.  But, it is very cute.  I guess he can be a dragon for the next 3 years or so!"}

I really am impressed!  I did order the tall size (am 5'5&#34;) because I wanted it longer, and it came as 30&#34;...otherwise it would have been too short for my taste.  I hand wash it and hang to dry so not to take a chance on hurting the embroidery."}

It's a little long waisted, but she'll have some room to grow into it. She's very comfortable in it.<br \/><br \/>Con: it is nylon and polyester so careful washing it.

It only took 13 days to get to me from China and was shipped via USPS ePacket and came with a tracking number! The wig is very gorgeous and I love it!<br \/><br \/>There are only two downsides for me.<br \/><br \/>1: is that I wish it had clips sewed in at the ear flaps\/temples<br \/>2: is that I noticed around the bang area on the right (when the wig is on) you can just slightly see the edge of the wig where the bangs part from the rest of the hair, but if you play around with the bangs or wear them to the left then it's all good.<br \/><br \/>Other than that, it's really nice and easy to put on and mine came with a wig cap. It doesn't tangle at all and is easy to brush through gently with a wide tooth brush or comb.<br \/><br \/>Edit: I would have shared an image, but apparently Amazon is no longer allowing this as I've noticed one reviewers images that were on this product are now gone."}

I bought an XL and when it arrived, the inside tag said XXXL. The sizing is so askew that I could only give it three stars b\/c under most circumstances, women would be disappointed with the fit. Even though I'm not showing yet, it actually fit pretty good - to the point that I could get away with wearing it now and I'm a US size 4. So definitely size up!"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"When I saw the inauguration, I was struck by Michelle Obama's gloves. My new coat is purple not green, and I looked in every physical store for a pair of purple, or in this case, berry colored gloves, and found nothing.<br \/>  I own a pair of black leather gloves that are high end, lined with white rabbit fur. I love my leather gloves. Cashmere is equally as good.<br \/>  On Amazon, which I should have  visited first, I found many pairs of purple leather gloves, of all prices. None were, what I'd call, cute, like with buttons, or braided leather embellishments. I turned to the sale area, and found these Alfani gloves. My hands are 6 3\/4 inches, as measured in the exact location of the instructions. I ordered the size 7, which is correct.<br \/>  They arrived quickly. I immediately tried them on,and I thought they were a bit tight across the knuckle, even though I measured my hand. But, for the price, they are gorgeous. They are stylish with extra length, that covers my watch,and fits under my coat. My complaint is they are a bit plain. Can colored gloves be a bit more stylish? As for color, Wow! They are eye catching. Perfect match for my coat, which makes me want to wear them.<br \/>  As for warmth, I don't think they'll be as warm as my rabbit fur lined gloves. The cashmere lining is not what I am used to,and it might become itchy. That is why I titled this For Glam, Maybe For Warmth. They look so stylish, and the sale, was totally worth the price. They are so elegant, that I ordered a second pair, size 7 1\/2, which, by measurements would be ample sized. I like to have spares, if at all possible.<br \/>  I am keeping this pair, they are definitely gloves not to be put into the coat pocket, but into the purse after removing."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"They aren't of entirely terrible quality for the price but I ordered knowing the ran a little small. I wear a 34-36 in jeans and The xxl are way small the legs are so tight I could never climb in them. So I guess I'll just have to spend the money"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I really like the way these fit me.  They do not ride up and the leg bands are not tight. (Can't see bands thru your pants.)  They don't go up as high as others I have tried - so I am not worried about my underwear sticking out above my pants when I bend over.  The only reason I don't give them all 5 stars is because they don't really last too long.  Edge will start fraying after a few washes.  But I still buy because I can't find a better fit."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love these baby socks! They are soft and wash and wear nicely but most importantly, they stay on baby's feet and that's hard to find!"}

The back and front are held together by small circles of velcro which held up but are beginning to not stick to the plastic now.  The mask slides up to reveal the face and is held on with plastic tabs and elastic string.  With the mask down, it gets VERY hot inside as there is little to no ventilation.  For the price though, it served its purpose but don't expect this to be a movie relic fit for a showcase."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"What makes a man? Some say it's a successful career, a loving family, or confidence. Sure -- those are great, if you're a SHEEP.    No, *this* is what makes a man. Style. Class. And some patchy facial hair.    Allow me to convey to you a story. One afternoon, I departed my mom's basement on a quest of the most noble of purposes. After blinking away the harsh sunlight, I mounted my mighty steed (a '97 Geo hatchback that supports my ample girth), and galloped towards my sanctuary of spiritual fulfillment (no, not church you STUPID CASUAL, I don't believe in fairy tales) -- this Mecca is known as \\\\\"7-11.\\\\\" I required nourishment for a looming Warcraft instance raid, and had precious little time before My Little Pony aired on the Hub.    However, before I could secure my flagon of their finest Mountain Dew --the only elixir powerful enough to fuel my warrior drive-- I came upon a tall, muscled man and his companion, a comely lady worthy of only the truest Gentlesir. Through her fair lips, she asks him to buy her some lipstick -- and he says \\\\\"no!\\\\\" This was too much.    I open my trench coat, and lightly brush the throwing stars on my belt with my fingerless gloves, to warn this \\\\\"Bro\\\\\" that I am a knight not to be trifled with. Bowing deeply, I take m'lady's hand, kiss it, and say \\\\\"M'lady, a princess as beautiful as you has no need for such foul commodities as makeup. I am giving you $15 just for being so stunning. You would honor me if you accompanied me later to Gamestop.\\\\\"    To my utter amazement, this fair maiden recoils and suggests that -while I am nice enough- she'd prefer to just be friends. Well I don't offer $15 to just any whore off the street. Clearly my superior intellect failed me. I mounted my Geo-steed, sped home, and retrieved my fedora. Placing it on my head, I felt a deep swell of euphoria sweeping over me. My intellect expanded like the Universe after the Big Bang. I didn't need my Geo to return. I simply closed my eyes, channeled the power of my fedora,and opened a time-space wormhole between my basement and 7-11. Looking my fair Maiden in the eye, this time I tipped my fedora (ever so gently), nodded my head, and simply uttered the word \\\\\"M'Lady.\\\\\"    I will not betray a lady's dignity by saying what happened next. Let's just say, my fellow Kind Sirs, 7-11 needed to lay sawdust down on the ground between M'lady's legs. This Fedora has that power.    Pros:  1. Intellectual Enlightenment  2. Power to woo M'Ladies  3. Protects against harmful sunlight  4. +15 Dexterity    Cons:  1. Largest size too small for heads swollen by Mountain Dew and Science.  2. Inadequate protection against cheeto dust (keeps it from hair, does not keep from beard).    4\/5 would buy."}

But I still wasn't ready to pay $60-70 for a 4 year old and possible get destroy at the wedding and that's it. Also, the tux store only have regular suit type tux.  I wanted a penguin tail tux for my boy so he can look like little prince.  When I came across this seller through random browse and saw her price plus free shipping, I was crossing my fingers that it will be in high quality since the price is just AWESOME!

Thought I would add these to the collection of cute socks to wear to yoga or to wear showing between my ankle jeans and my sneakers.  Not so.  Frayed socks are not cute. The other two don't appear to have the same problem, but they are just plain grey.  So they aren't cute and therefore have nothing to redeem them from being sweat holding synthetic socks.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"No complaints.  The socks are tall enough and don't bind like some seem to do.  The color selection is nice.  They wash well.....I'm sure I'll be back for more."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Bought these pajamas for my mom as a Christmas gift, I knew my mom like M&M's so I bought them for her. She loves them."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"First I must say this dress is true to size. I wear a size 8 jeans but usually buy a 10 in dresses to ensure breathing room. I ordered this in a 10 and it looks great- the top slides down a little easy, maybe I should have gone with size 8?  It looks amazing, and you can' t beat the price for such a pretty dress. I was surprised at the comfort. it's very light and as comfy as a nightgown. I will order this brand of dress again and again!<br \/>Thank you Ever Pretty!! finally a no hassle formal Christmas party purchase!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I really like this tunic. It's super soft, comfortable and very cute. I would have given it 5 stars but the color is not as advertised. the picture is actually grey but the one I got is much darker than the photo and almost has brown\/green undertones. Definitely not a deal  breaker though, I would order this again, especially since it doubles at a nursing top! well worth the money!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Not a bad dress for the money"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Beautiful dress and fits like a glove. I love the hourglass figure it gives me. I am 5'1 and weigh 100 pounds and am wearing the medium. The dress stops midway between my knees. Super comfortable and definitely worth the price. Only problem was I had a single loose thread which I snipped right off. I was disappointed to see that there was no size small, but seeing how well the medium fit, I'd recommend ordering a size up."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Beautiful :)"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"nice dress but the sizing is wayyyyyyy off...mercy"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The material was flimsy and way too small for a size small."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Somewhat small for me. I have large calves, but overall what I needed!"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"I ordered 3 of these hats in 2 different sizes.  They sent them in the wrong sized combination."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"I originally gave these a 5 star rating, however since I have worn them TWICE they have completely fallen apart.  They developed tiny holes in them after the first (hand washing).  They are absolute crap!!  Too bad, since they fit so well."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I'm a big girl and got this dress for graduation when I put it on it was so comfortable, it did not pinch anything on my body and it was not cutting my circulation. I got a size XL and usually wear a size 14 in pants. Posted a picture of me wearing it on Facebook and got lots of likes. I did add a black belt to it because it needed a little bit of enhancement in the mid section. Will buy more from the same seller, but different styles."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This really is a very nice belt-I like the wider width, and the substantial feel of it. It's perfect with jeans or casual dress, and was a welcome addition to my closet-wish they had the same thing in black."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Such a great material!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This is soft and luxorious.  Feels great. Oversized and snappy looking.  I usually do not look good in brown but this brown works well."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Sadly, I've gotten bigger.  These did not fit.  Love the overall idea though as this is my day-to-day work uniform of sorts."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Great quality and good for layering, but not as long as the image portrays. Still good though and a staple in my closet!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Great fit."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Making good use of this visor especially on bad hair days."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I received the 2 button black leather blazer in record time after I ordered it.  The leather is very good quality, and the blazer is very stylish. I recommmend this blazer to anyone looking for an all around casual wear jacket."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Product was very well made especially in comparison with the other underwear brands sold on amazon and definitely worth the few extra bucks."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I received this coat as a surprise gift this year and was really happy with it.<br \/><br \/>I am 5'11&#34; and 165 with an athletic yet curvy frame, and the large fits me near perfectly. In US sizing I range anywhere from a small to large (4-10) depending on material and construction for comparison. I struggle with most off-the-rack fitted\/tailored pieces because my shoulders are much more broad than my ribs and waist, so I am accustomed to jackets and coats being either too loose or too snug. Luckily this fits like a glove and I'm able to wear sweatshirts under it if I choose. Almost more importantly, the sleeves are long enough. :)<br \/><br \/>It came folded neatly in a zip-top, heavy plastic bag (exactly as they receive them at department stores) and didn't smell whatsoever. It's labeled &#34;wool blend&#34; so I'm guessing it's not 100% wool (which is fine by me). I'm not a fan of the little bow and had no intention of using it, so I didn't care that it was just a flat ribbon. Mine is the light grey, and pairs well with my entire wardrobe.<br \/><br \/>Hope this helps!"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Small, not cheap, the kind of socks you want one in beige and one in back when you want to travel super-light. I don't wear them every day."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I wear a 8-8.5 and my feet barely fit into the slippers. These slippers are so adorable and keep my feet warm. The slippers also look like the ones in the pictures so it isn't a cheap knock-off."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This is the perfect tank for the bigger busted lady.  I'm a 38D bust and size 12 Aust. and this fits really well."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Excellent"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"just beautiful!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"If workout gear is constantly part of your wardrobe then these are worth having in the rotation.  The price is right and so far they've performed better than I had expected."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"it's been through a few washings and has still managed to retain the deep black of its original color. i love showing off my bruins pride and have had quite a few people comment on it - seeing as i'm living in south carolina, it does catch the eye! ;)<br \/><br \/>comfortable and the perfect size, would recommend to anyone channeling their own boston spirit!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Beautiful fit"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I wear these socks with my Skecher Gowalk shoes. They are perfect - not too thin or thick. They stay up and never slip, plus are not visible outside my shoe. That is the main reason I got them! The only down side is the price. I think you should get three pairs for ten dollars instead of two. Otherwise great socks and cute patterns!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Runs a bit small. Fit more like a undershirt. Definitely recommend going up a size"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"This bra was a very tight fit. As a mom who was exclusively pumping, I wanted something that I could wear under my clothes. I think that this bra would be good for a smaller chested woman. As a roughly DD my boobs were always popping out, and would get pinched when I tried to pump because the bra was so tight."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"I have always liked Jockey brand tee shirts and shorts.  However, these I ordered online rather than purchased in a department store do not seem to be of the usual quality. The fabric is definitely thinner than others purchased in the past.  You know the thickness of new Jockey t-shirts.  These are as if they were washed about 50 times already.  The other problem- they are not bright white the way new Jockey t-shirt have always been.  Are these used?  It definitely seems like it."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This is a great jacket. We hadn't taken into consideration the sizes until after it was shipped, but as it turned out, it fit my son perfectly. Which was surprising because he's a tall teenage boy. The reason why we are giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because as awesome as this jacket is, it had one fault: Its smell. It smelled overwhelmingly of...chemicals? An industrial smell of sorts. It was extremely strong, and it literally took six runs through the washer and dryer to get the smell full out. Other than that, we're very pleased with the look and feel  of the jacket."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Good price, received right on time.  Very durable and comfortable."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My granddaughter loved the shirt, but it's a little small with no room to grow. I'll be exchanging it for a larger size."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very nice hat. I bought it for my husband and he really likes it. He uses it when he is in the sun to protect his head and neck."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I ordered a small but I'm a medium in female shirts (I'm a trans guy) I was afraid it'd be too big for me but it fit absolutely perfectly. The texture and fabric are high quality, hopefully I buy more shirts from this line since I have to spend money on cosplaying and guy clothing."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These boots are adorable and the quality is great. I'm sure they will keep my daughter's feet dry on rainy days. The size 10 fits my 4 year old daughter perfectly."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My husband loves this shirt. I bought him one to see how he liked it. He wants me to order more!"}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Cute but way too clingy and cut very small. Had to send it back."}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"too large around the waist, but not large enough for the package"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I don't like this men's jock strap because it is a bit tight.  I might recommend it to anyone who needs it."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"The only thing I do not like about the shirt is that I have to iron it.  My husband has other 100 % cotton shirts and even another Pacific Legend in black that did not wrinkle as badly as this one.  Also I washed in cold water with woolite for dark colors but it still lost a lot of the vibrant red which I suppose will look better after I get the iron out. It is still a pretty shirt."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Skirt came in a timely manner as always. The color was as shown and the fit was perfect. Looks great on my girlfriend with her black sweater."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I luv it"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"but not on me! I thought the shirt would be a 'concert-sized' medium, so I didn't get any size larger. Big mistake. I now have a great gift to give to someone smaller than me (5' 0&#34;, 115 lbs.) who loves Weezer. Maybe my 13 year old niece when she's a little taller.?.?"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These dresses are a great solution for the younger child who has to wear a uniform.  It allows them to express their personality and dress a little fun while still complying with the requirements.  They are well made and more girly than most uniform dresses."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It's barely slimmer than a regular wallet.  If you're looking for something to go in a front pocket, I recommend looking elsewhere.  If you're looking for a back-pocket wallet and you don't usually carry much cash, this is a very fine product."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I love this bracelet. It wraps around my wrist four times, so it has shows off a lot of beads. I had a hard time trying to get it tied. One of the beads fell off after just a couple of wears. Fortunatley, the beads are tied on individually so I haven't had anymore fall off since."}

What I didn't like was that when I went to put it on and tried to run my arms through the holes, the seams ripped from the back of the arm holes! I was devastated. I took it to a seamstress to have it repaired and she ended having to fix a lot of the arm seams. It appeared that the shirt was not properly sewn together when it was made. Beware, it may cost you more to repair the shirt then it is worth."}

Highly recommend these pants and the store (Bealls) that sent them."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Based on the reviews I thought I needed a US large - I am 5'11&#34; and 170 but quite muscular with slightly narrower shoulders (I usually always wear US mediums). The shirt did not fit well at all. On me (trim athletic\/muscular frame) the shirt was too thin in the arms, about the right shoulder width but long in the torso and also widened at the torso. Photo is misleading unfortunately."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I give this item 5 stars! Reason being that i ordered on 2\/14\/2013 and it got here today on 2\/19\/2013. When i opened the packaged, I was excited because evrything was how it was supposed to be. Right size, right color, right everything.....looks just like the picture. Nice frabic quality also!....ALSO i am 5'1 and a half feet so it comes down just a tad bit longer but other than that I am 100% satisfied."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Quick service.  However, the product did not seem cushioned at all.  I will not purchase more of these socks again.  Cushioned socks from Gold Toe have more cushioning and are a better value for the money."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My husband wears an XL, but they have always been too short to tuck in.  I found these t-shirts in tall & they fit him perfectly.  They are very heavy for a t-shirt, cover his belly perfectly, and very good price!  I bought one in each color."}

So I assumed Small was a children's small(4-5T), and so on. I ordered a small. When it arrived it said 6-12 months on the packaging, although it looked more like a 2T.  Either way, it did not fit my daughter, who was horribly disappointed and we had to rush out to get another costume for her Halloween carnival.  (No elephants at the store for such a tall girl  :(  )."}

I ordered up two sizes and it was no where near the right size. Plus the material is cheap and looks cheap. With shipping this comes to $50, I would have rather just waited for a good sale somewhere and get a real leather jacket. I don't want to send it back because then I would have spend $20 just in shipping! Don't waste your money, you are more then likely not going to get the right size no matter what you do. I am not impressed."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These are great for my 16m old. We don't use the thumb slot, we use them more like the infant gloves, but they fit nicely and are a soft fleece material. Highly recommend."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I really like this bathing suit! It's very cute, unique, and the top can be adjusted to wear in different styles. I've never had so many compliments on a bathing suit. Yesterday while lounging on the sand, three separate women came up to me to compliment it, and asked where I purchased it.<br \/><br \/>The bottoms are exactly as they appear, and are high-wasted, though there is ample room at the top to fold over if you'd like the waist to be lower.<br \/><br \/>The top is a single piece of fabric. It's not a pre-made\/folded top by any means. Picture a long scarf made from lycra. You need to twist and tie it to get it to look like the photo, and no instructions are provided. It took me a solid ten minutes to figure out how to correctly style it.<br \/><br \/>A couple of (slight) downsides....<br \/><br \/>Quality: The quality is not fantastic. The fabric is VERY thin. It's a bit see through.<br \/><br \/>Practicality: Ok...there's just no way I could swim in -- or do much of anything--in this bikini. As I said above the top is essentially one, single, long piece of scarf-looking fabric. I'm on the larger size of medium bust wise, and there's a LOT of room at the top diagonal part from the armpit up to neck, even when I tie it tightly. If I bend down at all, I'm exposed. This is definitely more of a &#34;fashion&#34; bikini versus a &#34;swimming \/ water activities&#34; bikini, which I found out the hard way at the beach yesterday!"}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"I'm 5'3\\\\\" and 127lbs and this piece is not the best - it'll fit as pictured; hence she has her legs crossed---well that's because it does NOT cover that area - cuts from the front to the back - not comfy at all."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Just as expected. This brand never fails me."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"First of all, I bought this thinking it was for a baby...because it says baby. Now I see that it says fits adult male. My bad. BUT it still runs very big. Even for me. I don't know why there are so many different listings for these hats in each size instead of just one listing with a size option."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Item arrived as described. I ordered the Large (12\/14) and it fits me perfectly. A comfortable fit, not snug, which I had hope when I placed the order. I'm 5'3 and the dress covers my knees. The quality of this dress does not scream cheap at all. Happy with the dress & seller. Will buy from them again."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These mittens are soft and of great quality.  I have been looking for mittens without the elastic stretchy band which irritates the wrist and comes off in the wash making the mittens lose function.  These mittens seem to be sewn a little different where the elastic would be, but in a good way...NO elastic AND stretchy, amazing!  The newborn size should fit at least 6 months."}

For size reference; I am a pear-shaped size 16  and the XL fits perfecty.<br \/>The dress is very flattering on me.  The cotton fabric is lovely and silky, the dress skims my hips but isn't a shapeless 'tent' at all.  Subtle and I could wear it any wear, any time.  I bought the black, and will buy the purple if amazon ever gets it in my size."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Tried this on right away after recieving, was so excited.  I'm a very active mom-to-be and was looking for extra support expecially during workouts.  At 29 weeks and having gained 25 lbs already, I found that the small was a little too small, but the medium too big- the small was hard to get on and off because it was tight at the top especially, but once on was generally comfortable.  Product irritated the underarms at the seams when active.  Belly portion fit well and was confortable, but the band at the bottom did irritate my skin a bit, and felt \\\\\"tight\\\\\" because it was somehwat narrow elastic (2\\\\\").  Very see-through garmet.  Nowhere near sufficient as a  sportsbra, even for small chest size.  Does provide significant warmth as a base layer, so with addition of sportsbra and t-shirt, got overheated easily.    Overall, plan to return, as there seem to be better products out there that are wider at the bottom, and not integrated as a shirt\/bra as well."}

Its super warm tho. I was just trying it out when it came and i started feeling really hot. Its really good for the price however i would rather buy a crewneck from jackthreads for the same price or maybe a little higher and get a super comfy amazing quality crewneck..."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"great skirt for the money, i also wear it as a tube dress!  the material is kind of thin so you'll need a slip underneath."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This dress is comfortable and fits a bigger woman. Make sure it is the plus-sized option. I am a 24, and this dress is slimming, and looks very cute. My only complaint is that it's a little tight around the top chest area, but still fit with ease, it only made putting on and taking off a little hard. You can't beat it for the money."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Absolutely love this item. Thi pin is perfect for parents, grandparents friends and relatives that have or know an autistic child. Will be buying more in the furture."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love these tights, I have been hunting them down by style number. I never thought these would end up being a favorite- I loaded a uhaul with moving boxes in them and they didn't rip! Not to mention they have the allure of fishnets without all the stigma that wearing fishnets has. They go really well with geometric patterned dresses, kind of psychedelic. I know it's hard to tell from the picture, but these have a great pattern. Just the right amount of oomph without being obnoxious."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought two pairs of these pants for my husband and brother-in-law who are twins.  They have an odd size 33\/34 which is nearly impossible to find in stores. When these Hagger pants arrived they fit perfectly and looked great. Couldn't have asked for more.  Will definitely purchase more in the future."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"These are really colorful and well made socks for the price. My daughter, being nine, could not wait to put them on. Well she did so before I got them washed. They left a huge red itchy rash all over her feet. It stayed there for about 24 hours. So just a warning, make sure to wash them prior to use. :)"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Overall I do like this product, it is really cute. The product looks great with leggings the only issue I have is that the arms are too small and in the shoulders it's too small. I can still wear it and I do it would just be better if it was a little bigger."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I bought these for my son on his 5th birthday. They are very cute, soft and seem to be durable enough. I have washed them several times now and they have retained their color and shape. I am very pleased with my purchase"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This shirt is true to its size it fits nice and is not sheer which is great the only negative with this top is that it slides down alot doesn't stay in place. Which makes it a better under shirt if anything but its decent and I would still buy it again ."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fit a little smaller than expected. I take an XL but this was an XXL. I upped the size because of past reviewers warnings. Color and fit is exactly as in picture. Good price too."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"You can't beat this for the price.  I didn't need anything super fancy.  My son was looking for something to wear to a dance and this worked perfectly.  It was nicer than I anticipated so I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I wash these in a mesh bag so they are easy to keep track of and let them air dry. They have been washed 3 or 4 times and they have not pilled like another review said. They are not itchy- actually quite soft and my son loves wearing them."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Looks great, shipped quickly. Overall a good shirt. If you are a busty girl, Expect the graphic to be stretched out. Better for girls with a smaller bust size."}

I ordered a large and am shocked that they are a little tight. I still only weigh 147lbs at 13 weeks pregnant, but these are a little tighter in my legs and behind. I'm back to order another pair and may try the x-large. All around, I like them."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Not enough effort was put onto it.  You can't return since it comes from China it will take million years to get there and will cost u as well, the lining is soooo terrible it's white and it shows big time on a black coat. Their customer service was not bad, they gave me a discount after complaining. Iam very disappointed mostly on the lining that shows.  It came with a ridiculous amount of lint! 3 stars is only for the style. I get a lot of complements with it. Good luck. Oooh and not forgetting the falling off buttons!! Urg!! Very nice coat i just wish they  had put more effort on it, I wouldn't have minded paying extra money on it because the design is very cute."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"This did its job, but I am thinking I should have ordered one size up.  Definitely gave me cleavage, but not lift.  Works in fitted dresses (ie strapless) but not sure this would work for a loose fitting top."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This costume is great quality. As others have said, the straps really should be attached to the cups. There is no way the cups will stay up on their own on me. If I decide to keep this costume, I will probably use fashion tape until I can modify the strap location like another girl suggested. The gown isn't too long. The XL hangs just above the ground for me barefoot (at 5'4&#34;). I found the XL to be great in the cups for my 40&#34; chest. Even though my measurements put me squarely in the XL, I think a large may have fit a little better. It is a tiny bit big, but it's not enough of a problem to return it based on that."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought this for an event for my son and thought it was an investment for that one event but I then realized that if I mix and matched some of these pieces with other things in his closet, I could construct many nice outfits. Truly a great buy and great material."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"If you hike, you need these socks!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I am 5'9&#34;&#34; and this skirt length is perfect. I love the material on the black\/tan gingham print. The material is substantial and not see through. I will probably buy another."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I love these pants and 90% of my work pants are Dockers, they fit really good and they are very comfortable, I only have two complains, the first one is that the color fades really easily, and the other one (maybe not important for most people) is that the pictures show the external Dockers label, which I like very much, but the three pants I ordered came with an embroidery logo and not the usual label, that is OK but the pictures are not accurate."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This wrap has plenty of room, in fact, it's big on me, but, that's ok.  I'm happy with this product.  This wrap absorbs well.  The only thing I would change is, adding some straps."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"The sizing is very confusing on this item. So be aware when you order the &#34;small&#34; it's mens small and will only fit women with a size 10 or larger."}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"After one wash the waist band started falling apart. Plus, they fit a little small. The fabric is soft and colorful."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I purchased these to go on my 2014 Novara FlyBy. They arrived a bit twisted, but seem to have relaxed into their proper shape over the course of a few days. The stays required shortening, which I accomplished with some handy bolt cutters, although I'm sure there are less dramatic cutting methods that would work just as well. Assembly does require removing the rear wheel, so be sure you're comfortable with that if you choose to order a pair. I had the chance to test them after a rain not long ago, and sure enough, they keep the wheels from flinging water up at me. Well done."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Just got this item. I am a big guy (6'5&#34;, 250) and the 48L fits well. The material is soft, not scratchy like a comparable wool coat I saw at a local Kohl's store. The liner is a deep, lustrous red that makes me feel like old school Dracula. I like the simple lines, its classic elegance, and am impressed with the quality thus far."}

I mean, yes it unlaces, but no not for a better fit. normally wearing a 1x according to measurement chart, I ordered a 4x.... & still doesn't fit correctly. not sending it back tho, cause it would cost more than the corset itself. did give it 3 stars because over all, it was made very well. just not the right fit. specially for someone with a longer torso. but hopefully someone I know can get some great use out of it so it isn't a completely waste of time & money.."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Let's just be honest here...I look good in this shirt :)<br \/><br \/>I have a couple of other shirts in this line from Port Authority that I have worn for 4 years--usually at least once a week. In four years, they have not worn out.<br \/><br \/>So, I bought more. The light brown color is good, the fit feels good, and the quality is just like the shirts that have held up to multiple washings and wearings. Rarely needs much ironing, doesn't show coffee spills, and does not feel too hot in the warmer times."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I just got my jacket and fortunately I listened to those who said to size down.  Typically I take a XXL in jackets, and in the slimmer cut ones sometimes even that is too small.  I went with the XL in this jacket and it fits perfectly.  Make sure you actually need this much warmth though - this is not something I'd want to wear in the 40s-50s.  Extremely warm and pretty heavy.  The hood is quite oversized but that seems to be the norm with jackets lately.  My only complaint is it isn't very fashionable like some of the alternatives (i.e. Canada Goose), but at 300+ dollars less it's worth it.  The zipper is also kind of weird, but I'm sure I'll get used to it."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Had to wear it for a wedding and it looks more yellow than advertised which was a good thing in my case. I was told by the seamstress who was supposed to bring it in that it was okay. It wasn't. I kept pulling the dress up the entire time of the wedding and that was not okay as I was the maid of honor. I put the flowers in front of me so I could hide the slippage of the front. If you purchase this dress make sure that you take very good measurements."}

In fact, at the luggage carousel at the airport last night, another flier commented how beat up my tag looked and made a comment that I must be a road warrior.  I'm not - I fly about twice a year.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I got the khaki (green) jacket, size XL. It fits perfectly. Looks very future-military. I am 5'6\\\\\" 165lbs and a bodybuilder. The length of the jacket is just right - comes right to my waist. It even fits great around my shoulders. There some elastic stitching in the back and stretchy fabric at on the sides and waist which gives the jacket some give for an adjustable\/body-hugging fit. This is nice if you're athletic \/ short because a lot of clothing made specifically for the US (even slim fit) have a more generous waist which can make you look heavier and shorter. Not so here. Nice snug fit. However as this is a slim\/fashion-fit you're not going to be doing jumping jacks unless you want to rip the seams. The zipper pull is on the opposite side from American jackets so that'll take getting used to.<br \/>If you have a wide waist or some paunch I wouldn't recommend this.<br \/>As far as quality, I paid $40 for it so I have tempered my expectations but it seems in line with the price. No loose stitching or anything and doesn't look like it's going to fall apart.<br \/>All in all a cool and stylish jacket! 5 stars because it's as described and for the price."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I had a hard time finding a nursing bra that fit properly.  This one could have fit better (it was a little small), but the design made it wearable.<br \/><br \/>My only big complaint would be this little fold\/notch in the very center of the top seam (in the cleavage).  While the bra is on and it's sitting mid-air in the cleavage area, it's not a problem.  But when you let one of the cups down to feed, it shifts the bra a little so that stupid notch is now on your skin and it is VERY irritating on your skin."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I bought both this EazyBelt and the slidebelt:http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00DR1EZ8M\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 at the same time and have used them for about 6 months alternating between one and the other.<br \/><br \/>Here are the major differences.<br \/>Eazybelt:<br \/><br \/>Much cheaper, but you have to order a specific size.  I ordered my size and wound up a little snug.  Now they offer to fix that, I never really took them up on it, but it's the same offer Slidebelts makes.<br \/><br \/>The ratcheting mechanism on the Eazybelt I prefer significantly.  It's MUCH quieter than the slidebelt.  Now to be fair, the slidebelt I got may not represent every type of buckle they offer, but when you cinch up the eazybelt, it's very quiet.  The slidebelt is very noisy in comparison.<br \/><br \/>As for the belt itself, the leather is thick and looks like high quality.  The slidebelt leather doesn't &#34;look&#34; as nice but interestingly it SMELLS of leather.  My wife said this has more to do with how the leather is finished then necessarily the quality of the leather, so I don't know what to say there, but I do like the actual leather smell that the slidebelt has.<br \/><br \/>My only flaw that I see on both belts is really it's Achilles heel.  The spot where the belt buckle attaches to the end of the belt (the non-ratcheting part) is small.  I don't know what the thinking was, but there are only 5-6 little pins in the middle on both belts that hold the buckle to the belt.  After some wear, I've found it to wear down, start twisting a bit and eventually even tear loose causing me to have to cut a 1\/4 inch off to secure it again.  I've also had a few times where it will just pop loose if the belt gets pushed into the buckle by accident and suddenly the buckle is on the floor or hanging off the ratcheting mechanism.  Anyway, my main annoyance with it.  I was able to fix the issue by wedging a piece of cardboard into the end of the buckle mechanism to keep it from popping loose, but wish it did that better on it's own.  There is no torsion on that piece for some reason so it really can be problematic.<br \/><br \/>Overall thought I still like both these belts.  This belt is thicker and I really prefer the ratcheting mechanism.  The Slidebelt comes in a much fancier case and seems to be a nicer leather, but the ratcheting mechanism is annoyingly loud."}

But it is very luxurous and silky to the touch. The colors are soft and muted. It is a very beautiful shawl.

I have half a dozen different shirts for the band, and they're all different in quality. This is possibly the worst. Globals Bomber shirt is ace, though. Can't fault them on that, or the price.

I love the 'classy\/peacoat' styling, it's a welcomed change from my kids' typical bubble or down jackets & the like. It runs a bit LARGE so keep that in mind when ordering. My oldest son has a  blue\/gray North Face that just came out and cost $200 but stopped wearing it when this jacket arrived! The prices are UNBEATABLE, even if this were a 'no-name' brand, but it isn't and THAT is something that our kid's WILL appreciate... ;-)"}

Will need some straightening or ironing of some sort but be careful when you do that also.<br \/><br \/>General rule is 2 sizes up. Normally a small? Get large. Normally large?

It's got room for everything you need, ipod, laptop charger, portable hard-drive, and slots for CD's or DVD's.<br \/><br \/>The backpack strap really makes it more useful too.  It's a shame they don't include it instead of the shoulder strap.  In fact the only way they could improve on this bag is if they decided to throw the backpack strap in for free."}

The sizes of this dress are listed as s\/m lg\/xl 1x\/2x and so on.

It fits me perfectly,(although I wish I looked slimmer, but that is the size I am!)  I am a size c chest, I don't think I would recommend this dress for a d though, because there isn't a lot of leftover room..<br \/>I read a lot of reviews saying this dress frayed or the embroidery came out in the wash, even on delicate cycle.  HELLO!! THE INSTRUCTIONS SAY HAND WASH IN COLD ONLY!!!  I couldn't believe all the bad reviews written about this product because they did not follow the care instructions!  The dress is beautiful and the embroidery is amazing!  I love the length and surprising enough wasn't super long on me even though I am short.  Very comfortable and beautiful color!"}

I have a small head and the usual small size baseball style caps make my head look even smaller. This cap has an elevated, somewhat structured top that lends some height to my head. And it even looks sorta cute...much more stylish than a baseball cap. Plus this cap doesn't result in serious hat hair. And it is very well made. The only downside is that it must be dry cleaned or hand washed. I am guessing washing in cold water in a lingerie bag and hang drying will be fine. Highly recommended!"}

I'm hippy and I have a little bit of stomach and love handles. (5'2&#34;, size 14, 36D-30-44 if that helps.)<br \/><br \/>This dress fits beautifully. I ordered the large. I think even a medium would have fit my hips well but not sure if I it would have given adequate coverage for the girls. The dress comes to about my shin area and I think I'm right at the border for it still looking good (vs. just fitting.) My hubby loved it. My only dilema now though is that it might be too fancy for just every day where. i bought it for an upcoming cruise but after the cruise I'm afraid it will hang in my closet.<br \/><br \/>Regardless, don't pass it up. If you're doubting, get it. The cut is flattering to most shapes and you will feel so sexy in this. Plus the biggest dilema is deciding what shoes to wear with it because all you have to do is throw on a bracelet and you're set!"}

I would recommend it to anyone looking for this style hat."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I will always remember the Summer of 2014 as the battle of the lines.  For some reason, my son (3 yrs old) has the biggest gripe with the seams of socks.  Regardless of how cool the socks looked, with all the different superheroes or fancy colors.  Every morning we would always get into a yelling match on perfectly adjusting the socks to his feet.  Should the socks be off by 1 degree, he would yell at the top of his lungs - NO LINE ON THE BOTTOM!!!  I've tried teaching him to put on his own socks - but that turned into a 20 minute debacle with a 3 yr old meltdown.  It's gotten into such a tedious routine that I would try to set aside 10 minutes just to deal with his sock issues.  As my wife and I vented our frustration to each other, she said to google for seamless socks.  OMG - why didn't I think of that before.  So I went straight to Amazon which has many different products and with very helpful reviews.  Behold, Jefferies seamless socks!!!  The 2 day shipping couldn't arrive more quickly.  As I revealed the socks and as my son tries on the socks, he smirks and says - hey, no line on the bottom???  Sheer joy shines on all of our faces.  Now, I joke with my son that whenever he does anything wrong - I will say - I'm going to put line on the bottom!  He will always smile and say no daddy, these socks don't have lines.  THANK YOU JEFFERIES SEAMLESS SOCKS!!!"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This fit better than I thought I would. It IS somewhat like a tent -- sort of a trapeze  or A-line shape -- but the thin rayon makes it drape well enough that I don't feel the shape is a problem. It is pretty cheap-feeling material and probably won't last a long time, but it wasn't that expensive. It would be nice to see this in a better fabric. Sizing-wise, I'm around a 16 and I got the Large, and it fits perfectly. I'd also say the neckline was scoopier than in the picture, but not so much as to be revealing. I got black, and I don't think I'll have to wear a cami under it, but I can see how lighter colors might require that. I figure it'll shrink in the wash -- rayon does -- but hopefully not too much."}

You might need to buy additional audio extension cables (like I did) if you are plugging this into a monitor, because you will have to plug the audio into a separate pair of speakers or a receiver, and the audio cables are right next to the VGA cable.   The quality of the signal is SO much better than traditional RCA composite video, and is even on par with HDMI.   All in all, very happy with my purchase."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My daughter is size 10\/12 so as I read other reviews I bought a size bigger 14 and fits her perfectly. Love it!!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"i was not sure about  buying this bra, it did not show back, it does have hooks,which makes it easy to put on"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It was a good idea, but the one drawback is that the ring snuggy comes off the ring too easily. I lost several of the huggies until I decided to close the gap with a layer of scotch tape."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This dress is well made. The stitching was nice and tight with no loose strings hanging from it. The picture does not do it justice. It is stunning in person. The contrast of colors and textures is just lovely. My daughter was thrilled with this purchase. It's not a &#34;long&#34; dress, but comes just above the knees. She is, however, just a bit tall for her age. We purchased this with the intention of using it as a long shirt with leggings. Though it's long enough to be used as a dress, but may not meet a &#34;to the knees&#34; school dress code."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Perfect for my little girls birthday !!! Her birthday just passed on March 20th and she wore it all day. She even wore it to the gas station when she bought her first lotto card!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The fabric is breathable. The gel on the Achilles portion keeps the socks from sliding down in shoes. Great fit, great feel."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I was scared it was going to come too small because I have big boobies but it was perfect! Love love love this top. Just in time for summer."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"The initial fit appeared perfect,  but after wearing a couple hours,  the pants would inch down. Nice fabric and style."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Waist, seat, pouch too loose compared to waist size. Repeated washings in hot water failed to correct baggy fit. Not worthy of MJ, not worth returning."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"These shorts are cute and appear to be a good quality considering the price.  The little gemstones in the button and rivets are cute, but the shiny logo on the back pocket seems too large to me."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"For the price paid, the dress was great.  I liked it because it fit well, and have noticed people saying it runs small.  The sizing chart helped a lot, and I'm not really sure how a 3x could possibly fit someone who is a size 10.  I'm well beyond a size 10(Depends on the brand but I run from 18-22) and managed to fit into a 2x. As for the chest, I'M ELATED to find something that fits me there.  It's often very hard for me to find a dress of a larger size that fits the chest since I'm not that big...just big elsewhere LOL.  The quality could be better however, it serves its purpose.  I'd recommend it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very nice sweater. The fit is something like a slim cut, fits perfect. It is warm and a very soft material."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Excelent \u2661"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"very nice fit and support, I am a 38G, and ordered a 40G and the cups fit nicely and the band offered great support. This bra is not a moulded cup, so there is a problem with nipples showing under shirts!"}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Too large"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very nice - I found this hat online through multiple other retailers for MUCH more expensive.  On my 11 month old it wears like a beret.  However, on an older child or one with a larger head, it would fit more like a beanie (as shown).  However, on my small baby it doesn't quite look the same.  The item looks in pictures EXACTLY like it does here.  I was very pleased! :)"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I loved the double button look, so I took a chance on this shirt.  However, when I went to put it on, one of the buttons fell right off!  At first, I thought that it came without a button, because I didn't even get a chance to try it on...and then I noticed the button on the floor."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love these sweats. Great for lounging around the house. Very comfortable. Nice weight fabric. At 6'-3&#34; 240 lbs., the size X-large are a great length for a taller person. They are long when you first receive them but after one wash and dry they shrink up to the perfect fit."}

It came in the mail before the delivery date, and shipped fast.<br \/>I was pleasantly surprised to find 2 wig caps ! Either I didn't read enough, or this is a bonus. Either way very please for the price.<br \/>They're very sturdy. Would definitely recommend."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"love it it lookws great and is durable... I would recommend it to everyone. Im buying more colors for me and my boyfriend"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Wow! Flattering suit! I first saw this suit at a Spanx store. While I love Spanx tights and panty hose, I am not a bit fan of their other clothes but I thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did. It is so flattering. It is basically a tight bodysuit with top over it that ends in a skirt. The top has a nice underwire that provides just enough coverage. I am so happy. This is a suit I can wear in public with no worries."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Awesome T-shirt. It was exactly as the picture shows with awesome details, there are little grey skulls on the vest portion that were not described in the details. I love this shirt and wear it all the time"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"White is tight and see through, if the shipping weren't so expensive, I would return. It reminds me of tissue paper. The straps are flimsy little ribbons."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It was wider and heavier than I expected. It is very durable."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It fits, but barely covers my ears, so when moving, it slides up.  I do have a fairly large head (hat size 7 3\/8). Not ideal for really cold or windy conditions, but I use in combination with a hoodie or jacket, so it does the job."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I like the color and fit, but after first wash the threads of fabric started to fall off around the collar. I mean it is not too bad and the shirt is not falling apart, but annoying."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I love the cut and style of the pants and what a great deal! They were a bit snug.compared to my other pants, but I would definitely buy a few more pairs."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Fits more like a shirt and not a tunic, but still cute! Fits true to size, the length isn't as long as it needs to be to wear as a tunic."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"This is a lovely dress, and I was looking forward to wearing it as soon as it arrived. The dress was smaller than I expected -- the XL was too snug and I am a 14. Pretty enough that I will aim to fit in it later this summer."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The product arrived very quickly, and I was pleased because I ordered it late and needed it for Christmas. The fur was a mess. I had hoped after it came out of the packaging it would settle down, but it didn't. I ended up trimming the fur by hand."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These socks stay on! And if you have a baby, you probably know that it's a struggle to keep little socks on . . . so these are well worth the price! I've received tons of compliments on the bunny toe socks. Overall, just a great product. I've got more Robeez socks on my wishlist for my baby!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Rich heavy weight scarf that allows one to be somewhat creative. This color matches a leather bag and suede shoes I have so it coordinates nicely. Wish it had a matching hat. I'll keep looking."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very warm my loves them but says they do ball up after a little while."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My son loves this jacket so much! I will not argue with that given that it looks absolutely adorable on him, the price is right, finding rain boots [even an umbrella] are not at all difficult due to the perfect hue of the Navy ~ So much to say about one jacket it is ridiculous ha! Literally, my 3 1\/2 year old tore open the package and put it on; he would not take it off and even fell asleep with it! [I think it helped that his newer slippers happened to match the inside plaid lining ha ha as if they went together. Silly kids~]."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"It looks cool, but the plastic came cracked.  To me it looks like a low grade plastic that wasn't molded very well."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I purchased this 12-18 month sailor suit for my 1 year old's birthday.  It was of course a little large on him given that he was at the low end of the age range, but that was to be expected.  The quality of the material was excellent, and the birthday boy seemed to enjoy wearing it.  I highly recommend this outfit for parents looking for cute pictures of their child."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It's simply amazing"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The hat is very good for cold weathers especially in winter. It can even cover your ears but it is too long for me, the tip, it make me looks like a dwarf....but it's cozy..."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"nice for what you pay."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I've work Lucky brand for years and these did not disappoint. The only negative thing I can say is that I can't find my size in these or any others on Amazon anymore, which is frustrating because I was going to buy another few."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The sweater was very light and comfortable, however the sleeves were so tight that nothing with sleeves could be worn underneath the sweater."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This adorable 2 pack of vintage style Batman shirts are not only attractive, but they are well constructed and made of soft cotton. The colors are exactly as pictured, the size seems to be right on, and the pattern is part of the material and not ironed or painted on."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It was ok"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"These tights are garbage. I have an 11 year old who dances regularly. These are the only tights I've ever purchased that ran after one wear. Every pair. I bought 8 pairs. They are junk. Do yourself a favor and don't buy them."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great product, it is beautiful and great quality, gave as a present and she loved it. I would definitely recommend buying one!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Perfect fit and great quality"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I like this shirt a lot though it does seem to me to fit a bit small because I have to be really careful about which pants\/skirts I wear it with or else it really accentuates my muffin top\/belly fat. I chose a size Large after looking at the size chart provided by Patty Boutiq but I kinda wish I'd gotten s size XL. (my first choice before reading the size chart) It is a really pretty top, the color is very true to what is pictured and I have washed & dried mine at least 3-4 times since I got it and it has not shrunk at all. There are no loose threads or anything like that either even though my poopbrain ex bf &#34;accidentally&#34; threw it in the wash with a load of his work clothes once. It's definitely a good quality, well made and very attractive top and I am eagerly looking forward to buying more clothing from Patty Boutiq in the future."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"brought as gift"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"scrub pants look nice. The fit is a little awkward. I got an x-small.They fit in the waist, are bunchy\/baggy in the crotch area, a tad tight around thighs, with a nice length to pant legs."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This skirt looks and fits great- I got my normal size and I did not find that it was small- I also ordered a size larger to compare and return if necessary because I really wanted the look that this skirt offers. Has nice stretch so it hugs your hips, pretty sparkles on the pockets aren't overdone. Super comfy- love it!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Really well made for a costume."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great work gear"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Good"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great product"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I first saw this at Nordstrom Rack for approx $24. I wonder how much it was priced at Nordstrom before it went to the Rack. The quality is good thick cotton, with the sweater getting a little thicker on the horse area because of the extra thread. The buttons are brassy. The elbows have a suede-look brown elbow patch (I think it's polyester) on the back of the elbows. It's adorable and has a classic look at the same time. I haven't washed it yet but I recommend a delicate cold water wash to keep the color intact."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Immediately after opening, this began to fall apart... in a hurry. Over a week later, and the feather-like fluff is still pervasive. Awful, awful product."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love it,  nice fit,  good price and fast delivery"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great gift, too small of size for person I bought it for"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very comfortable and washes beautifully. Does not pill."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This dress is beautiful. It is much nicer in person than in the pics. This dress fits like a glove, I get so many compliments whenever I wear it. It can transition from day to night. The fabric is heavy yet breathable. I am so happy with this dress definately one of my top purchases. Can be worn for so many different things. I wore it to a funeral with a cardigan over and to a cocktail party."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I like the glasses and for the price really can't be beat.  They are a little larger than I was hoping for more Drew Carey look than a hipster."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Made from good material, and they are very comfortable"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My granddaughter loves this skirt! She likes the pleated design, and it fits her well. She's a size 14 and it fits true to size. The length is good, it isn't too short. The stitching is even and it seems well made. As a uniform skirt, it's cute and not too plain. As a regular skirt, it's neutral enough to wear with a variety of tops. I would definitely recommend this skirt."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Not a good fit for full busted women. The cups are on the small side."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I have worn Hanes undershirts for nearly 20 years. I have tried other brands, including comparable-in-price Fruit of the Loom, and expensive brands, and Hanes never fails to disappoint. I get about one-to-two years on a shirt, and when it has simply worn out, they make great shoe shining cloths."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Ordered 2, gave one to my son for Xmas, he loved it as much as I did. Well made, the logo shows correctly on both sides plus it's warm & comfortable. Money well spent."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"really high quality and super sexy!"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"they fit perfect when u first buy them once u wash them they stretch out.  theres more the padding u have to cut out cause it twist all up and when u cut it out the shirts are so thin u can see though it so u see the whole very upsetting knowing I paid over 100 dollars for 4 of these never again!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"It is very pretty! I could only give it 4 though only because it is way more fragile than expected and seems like it handled much would fall apart fast. I have it on my Buddhist shrine though so it is perfect. I will order another I am sure!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love it.<br \/>Fits Perfectly"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This are great for everyday wear. Wish I had ordered more colors! Plan to get more of them  very soon."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Does what it says. The shorts lifted my buttons tremendously."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Dress ran small....daughter only wore it once"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Not as slim fitting as the picture, but if you but a belt around the waist it looks good. Without a belt it makes you middle look kind of big but overall a good buy. fits pretty well but the sleeves are a bit tight.Iit wasn't really a problem for me."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This slip is a lifesaver!!!  The perfect length.  No more clingy skirts for me!  And the lace is super cute if it peeks out the bottom of your skirt, too!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"What a great deal. All for were very pretty and all fit perfectly. Am ordering again, with the hopes I get 4 different ones!!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought the white and I love it. I wish it was available in more (warm) colors that I wear & I would get more."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Enjoying the skirt. The color is more of a burnt sienna than a brown so be prepared for an orange-ier brown rather than a dark chocolate color. The waist and length are perfect.  I do wish that your trademark symbol was in a less obtrusive color as the bright turquoise dot really stands out against the background of brown. It's a perfect travel skirt, just mist with water , and lightly pull wrinkles out, then wear!"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Very very small"}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Poor quality fabric, a cheap purchase, that looks so  cheap, I can't wear this, I love cardigans, this one is no doubt my worst, fits well, but won't wear it, the black should have been blacker, the white should have been whiter and new should have been newer"}

I bought it for my daughter but I think I want one of my own(hers is a small so I can't take that one).  The material was heavy not thin like I expected and well sized.  I feel Like I can trust this seller and will use them again!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great fit and quality! Love that pads are removable and that straps can be cross or bikini style!!! It would be just perfect if the inside fabric from the top would be cotton."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These socks are the answer to many miles of torture while running half marathons. Just when I thought I has tried everything, I tried these amazing socks. These socks have extra padding in all the areas that tend to rub the most and prevent blisters from forming. The offer arch support as well. These are my favorite running socks and are perfect for all weather use. I have and will continue to purchase more of these socks in the future."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"It's cute, I'm I've got to see how it looks w jeans. Thumbs up"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Not up to Carhartt quality.  Description says 6 oz. cotton, but it's very thin & see thru so it's more like 3-4 oz.  Wanted a heavier cotton for winter wear, but ended up returning these and going with Duluth Trading Co."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Very nice dress, but fits smaller than your size... The arm area is very small."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Bought these for a recent vacation as I knew I'd be spending a good amount of time by the pool and at the beach.  They contain no integrated underwear.  The material is comfortable to the touch but takes a while to dry.  Much longer than other swimwear.  Be forewarned - the white portions of the patterns are semi see-through, especially when wet."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It is a white shirt needed and what we expected but a bit overpriced for it is simply a white shirt."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Purchased for vacation for cool nights .. Was as described.  Arrived quickly also and I would order addtl products especially for the price... The length was great"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The quality of this hat is impeccable. Unbeatable at this price. I usually buy large\/XL. Got the XL and it fits slightly too big."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Seems good quality, but the fit is MUCH smaller than it says. I always go medium, (I'm 180, 5'11&#34;) but I could barely fit into this shirt, let alone move."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I loved the material and it fitted me perfectly. I hope it does not shrink or pull out of shape as I intend to wear this top for a long time. Would highly recommend."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I liked the fabric, drapey so it wouldn't wrinkle in a suitcase and the dress itself was beautiful. I followed other reviewers' advice and sized way up, and my 1X self fit in the 5X at the band where the glitter is perfectly. Alas, there was too much fabric on top and I couldn't alter it without ruining the sparkly band, so I have to send it back. Who would have thought my 40Ds would be TOO SMALL for a dress??? haha. I totally recommend it to other people with different body types though. Very pretty."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"They fit fine.  The material is a little thinner than I expected, but it will be good in the warmer spring weather."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I ordered this cardigan in black and received navy blue. The size is great, ordered large for a little less snug fitting. It's super soft and I could wear it forever. Literally. I'm in love with it already. I'm not returning it though because I was planning on ordering the navy blue anyways. So, hopefully, when I go to buy another black, it will actually be black. *fingers crossed* this picture shows the sleeve of the cardigan compared to my black work pants. It's not the best picture but it shows the difference."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This cardigan runs small but i have 2 others so I knew what to expect.  The material is soft and I like the availability of colors.  Thin material makes it perfect for summer.  The lack of buttons makes it easy to just toss on to complement your outfit instead of overpowering it. The dark grey material seems to be not as soft though. But i still like it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Extremelly comfy at a good price"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Was not sure about sizing as said junior size but I needed it for an XL adult so I went up a size.  Since it was a gift I hope it fit though they said it looked on the smaller size.  Postage excellent, received next day I believe."}

I had offered to return this vest but husband likes the way it looks and it's patches so I'm going to repair \/ replace the snaps with all new heavy duty snaps. The snaps that are on this vest are very cheap so if your planning on putting on extenders you may want to reconsider or replace the snaps first. The vests quality isn't that bad for cheap price with the exception of the snaps."}

I should have tried them on. Although the same manufacturer and size they fit really odd, small in parts, shorter than the pair I own. They were not cheap so I feel like I wasted my money. I did not save my packaging so I just accepted I was jilted. I will NEVER order from this company again."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"This is a heads up to anyone ordering these bib overalls. They are not stone washed according to Dickie's official site, they are simply Indigo Bib Overall.

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Fits great! Im currently pregnant 5'3 at 134 lbs. I got a size small.. the only reason why i did not give it a 5 star it because the material is thin. You'll have to be cautious on the color and type of underwear you wear or make sure you wear a long enough shirt to cover your butt."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Nice Ivy Cap for the price. It's a one size fits all, but it fits well and it's very comfortable. The white part in the middle of it is ventilated so it's nice for warmer weather. I use it as a golfing cap and I've received some compliments on it."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Trendy design, which I'm certain my niece will love, but it is so thin she could wear it in the summer! This is a SWEATER?<br \/><br \/>Also, there was a small hole in one of the sleeves, near a seam. I fixed it. There were also knitting imperfections which I could not fix. If this were for a &#34;grown woman&#34; I would return it. But since it is for a young person who will just thrash it anyway, I am going to keep it. Just be aware that this is not a quality item, even though cute."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"It is a fitted item just make sure you know that. I read the reviews of this item and figured &#34;ok it says falls out smaller so I just make double sure and order two sizes up&#34; so I ordered 2X when I generally wear a large. I am about 5 foot 8 inches and this jacket reaches at about the top of my jeans (not low cut jeans) and on my stomachs it is very tight when I wear a thin undershirt (tank top) with a work sweater\/blouse. The arms are perfect and the chest area is about right. I'm a 34\/36 C\/D cup of that helps you any. My stomach is not super flat but also not huge and this jacket makes me feel like I am a balloon, also when you sit down with the jacket everything else will ride up as well. It's a disappointing jacket to say the least. I gave it two stars as the design is as it shows on the picture. I like the fleece material as it feels cozy warm and soft. But It's such an ill fit that I cannot give it any more stars."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"It is a little small in the body but the cup size fit well."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very nice quality fleece.  Does seem to run on the short side.  I ordered a 12 month for our 6 month old and fits her perfect!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I could live in this! It is so comfortable, so soft and thin enough to be worn on hot summer days without being see through. It is a bit longer than I expected but that just allows for some great heals. It has quickly become one of my favorite items."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love it!!! It fit me so well but I do have a smaller chest so it was little big in that area. I do roccomemd having a half slip under or something thing like that because it is body-con you can see everything. Which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I am 5'3, 32A, and regular size 5 or 7 jeans and got the size 6 and fit almost perfectly."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought this not too long ago, and I've gotta say it was well worth my money. The bracelet is sturdy, the gems are just wow! I don't see this breaking anytime soon, not do I see the gems popping out. If you're a Kuroshitsuji fan I'd recommend this. Excellent buy."}

The shirt size I ordered, medium, was a bit small, and ThisWear replaced it with a large size. The shirt is substantial, not thin and flimsy fabric as some t-shirts tend to be, and the quality of workmanship on the stenciling is excellent. Recommended."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"This shirt looks real appealing in the picture. Once i received it i realized it has a few problems. The material was so thin and mesh looking i knew it wouldn't hold up after 2 or less washings. It also is not as long as the the one in the picture. If you are in to the midriff looking shirts, this one is for you.  Cute but went back in the same box it came in...."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Delicious jeans with a twist of unique-ness and a dribble of colour. Sexy fit and nice ass-end display. Comfortable in the crotch, narrow in the legs - but you must be quite skinny to wear these jeans. Fabric is awesome. Am I pleased? Absolutely!!!"}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"This shirt fits good but is on the smaller size. If you prefer to have more room I would suggest going up a size. Other than that, the fabric is nice and I love the thumb slits (though they too run a little smaller and cut into my hands)."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"I bought this in spite of all the bad reviews trying to give it the benefit of the doubt since the picture looks so beautiful. When I opened it, my jaw dropped, it had black\/grey stains all over it, was moist, smelled horrible and was way too small. I was so upset. I had read on the reviews that someone had this same experience and I didn't listen. How can these people be selling stuff like this. Bad thing is it came from china so a return would be too much trouble."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great fit! Love it!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Don't get me wrong, I love love love looooove this outfit. However, it does run super small. My 12 month old is really little (17.5lbs) so after reading the reviews about how small it was, I assumed it would fit her perfect.<br \/>I ordered the 12-18 month size. This size would probably fit the average 7 month old.<br \/>Be aware.. the color is not the peachy orange that is pictured. The color is MEGA BRIGHT orange. Think, &#34;Papaya on steroids&#34;.<br \/>The fabric is nice and overall, it is very well made for the price and looks super adorable.<br \/>I would definitely recommend this to parents of children 7 months and younger, or those with tiny tots like my own."}

This belt is perfect. It is approximately 1 & 1\/4 inches wide, has a great buckle, and lots and lots of holes for future use! I like it a lot. It is a good quality belt at a very fair price. You can't go wrong with that combo!!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very nice! Made my butt look lovely!!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very cozy, nicely constructed, plenty of length to keep your legs covered when you prop them up on a stool."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great design and feel of the material.  The description states it's made from 100% polyester, so I thought it would fit a little loose.  It's actually 92% polyester and 8% spandex and is between a fitted and compression fit."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great quality Product and a great price (pre usage review)"}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I'm returning these.  I have other pairs of CK jeans, also in size 6, and these seem to be the right size...however the material is so thin and stretchy that these quickly started to fit too loose in bottom and crotch just in the few minutes of trying them on and wearing them.  They're like a stiff pair of polyester leggings, not what I look for in jeans.  Long enough, could be a flattering cut if not for the bulges and sags in the crotch area and bottom.  Nice dark wash."}

Oh--the little itsy sparkle is barely noticeable"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Bought for my wife and she looks wonderful in it and it fits her great."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I really love these scarves because they are so inexpensive and have a classic look.  I know they will not be around for the long hall because they are not the best of quality - I have one in black and one in camel - and the camel one is frayed after only a few months of wear.  If that kind of stuff bothers you, you might want to steer clear.  But if you're like me and just want an inexpensive accessory to spoof up the wardrobe for a while, go ahead and buy away!"}

Since it is not padded I wear silicon breast petals with thin shirts and they work fine with the bra.  I spend much of my off work time in yoga clothes, no bra.  But for anything else, I highly recommend this bra.  The biggest bonus for me is no hook.  So, no line, just slips over the head.  And it has plenty of stretch."}

But looks more like a shirt then a loose blouse on someone built like me. If your more a size 10 or below I think it will fit you like it does the model. But in all its a nice top but Id have to loose some weight to get it to fit like the model. Shipping was fast. Happy Shopping"}

The fabric is so light it feels as if I'm not even wearing a shirt, but it is not so thin it's \\\\\"see through.\\\\\"  It fits much like the product photo.  It's not a tight shirt or clingy, but it's no muumuu fit, either.  Order your regular size.<br \/><br \/>You'll be very happy you bought this shirt.  Just beware it's extremely casual and suitable for chilling or going to a park, not to the office or church.  I recommend buying several, because you won't want to wear anything else.  Casual and feminine rarely meet effecively!<br \/><br \/>The blue is a lovely aqua.  I don't usually wear aqua, but this shade is flattering.  I also bought the hot pink.  I'd call it a deep pink, but pink it is, and it's a great color!  You KNOW you want the pink ;)"}

It will leave green hairs all over your back, your front, and anywhere you go. It's great for things like web shows and halloween costumes, but not for everyday. I guess you wouldn't be wearing it everyday unless you're a punk rocker, anyway. Oh, and speaking of web shows, mine is [...]."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"These pants were slightly long for me so I had to get them hemmed, but otherwise the fit was perfect.<br \/><br \/>My only small issue is that a few months into my purchase, one of the seams became loose and undid itself (where there is the elastic portion to hold up the elastic belly band area. It may have been better if they didn't reinforce it with the elastic (like most other maternity jeans). I was still able to wear them way into 3rd trimester.<br \/><br \/>Otherwise very comfortable and the side pockets are very useful and practical."}

That was on wensday the next Tuesday I got the jacket. I am 5'8&#34; 270lb this jacket fit perfect! Great soft lamb skin leather the tan color was amazing.  I would compare this to a jacket that is in the $300 to $700 price range. Room to move and when I buttoned up I look 20lb slimmer. The only problem I have is what jacket to order next!

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I purchased this to replace a cheap costume fedora I was wearing with something a bit better.  I am definitely satisfied with my choice!  It's well-made with very sturdy construction, and comfortable to wear even for long periods of time.  The material is very easy to care for (despite a cat whose fur tends to get all over everything within a forty-mile radius) and breathes well even in the hot Texas air.  One thing to note is that the top of the hat is not just folded in, but rather has a rounded surface that fits your head especially well, yet is recessed so as to not be obvious from the outside."}

He weights 26 pounds and 32 or 33 inches long he wouldn't stay still long enough to get it accurate!  But I ordered the 2 to 4 size cause they said go big.  I am glad I did, the costume is big on him but not swimming in it big.  I love that the head is just like a simple winter hat nothing in his face to pull at.  The costume is warm, we will only put a onsie on underneath it!  The costume fabric is thick and seems durable!

When I brought my pair I had to shave to leave no unsightly hair. The smoothness between my legs and the anticipation of the reacion of my boytoy only heightened my excitment. When my partner slipped off my jeans to see the g-string, he could hardly restrain himself and neither could I. Trust me girls. Buy these.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This dress is a steal at the sale price.  This is a really high quality wrap dress.  The fabric is what really makes it: soft, buttery, drapey and and not clingy.  I love the built in shoulder pads, they really make the dress hang nicely on me.  I'm pear shaped and often wrap dresses bag out on top and make my figure look unbalanced.  The shoulder pads fix this.  And they are totally stealth, not horrible 80s shoulder pads.  The neck is too low cut for work but that is easily solved with a safety pin or bobby pin, even.  For evening, the neckline is just WOW.  The length is a bit longer on me than on the model, as I'm only 5'4&#34;.  That works fine and there is a slight asymmetry to the hem that makes it OK.  I'm looking forward to wearing this dress without tights in the summer months (though the sleeves may limit the dress to cooler days)."}

The back is stretchy so it's easy to get on and off, and the straps are adjustable.  It modestly accentuates your curves- it doesn't hide the tummy section, but it does not look bad either because the fabric is thicker. You can easily wear a swim suit under it, or pair it with a jacket and heels for a fancy evening out. BUY THIS DRESS! If you think it's expensive, don't kid yourself. It's an AMAZING price for the quality. Besides, you can always return it if your don't like it, but I doubt you will. I want it in every color!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"These are good shorts just wish they had side pockets.  I knew they didn't have them when I bought them, but after I wore them a couple times I missed the pockets.  The little strings at the bottom by your knee are pretty dumb.  You can cut them off.  I did."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It does the job of making sure my dress doesn't stick and hides the see-through material. The stomach band is a little tighter than I would like, but I did just have a baby so I am sure it will be better after some time passes."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I measured according to the website & it fit perfectly (34FF) With age & kids, I've lost volume in the upper part of my chest so many bras have too much fabric at the top when purchased in the cup size I need. This bra has great support and is very comfortable with no loose fabric at the top of cup\/strap area.<br \/><br \/>It isn't very pretty...it doesn't (at least for me) enhance my bust...it works a lot like I though a minimizer bra would, except it doesn't reposition my boobs under my arms.. It enables me to wear shirts that would be too tight across the chest with any other bra.<br \/><br \/>It is lightly molded-just enough to hide prominent nipples and provide the slightest shaping. I genuinely believe & my daughter agreed, that I look like I've had a breast reduction when wearing it.<br \/><br \/>If it holds up, this will be one of the best bras I've ever found, and will be worn when I don't want my beasts front and center or attracting any attention."}

When this one gets too worn, I'll definitely buy another."}

I'm Dan's wife! :)"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"First time buying a latex mask for Halloween and this one looked so tight that I was sold on being a gargoyle..so, ordered it and started researching gargoyles and their purpose and look.  It arrived quickly and a cursory once-over told me I was not disappointed with the feel, looks and quality of this product.  It IS made very well and looks just like the online photos..even better I think.  I was ready to be a gargoyle!<br \/><br \/>So, being the impatient person I am sometimes...I ripped open the package, got in front of a mirror and immediately tried it on...not a good idea, no bueno.  As I opened my eyes the &#34;overflash&#34; from the molding process began poking me in the eye and I could not get it off fast enough.  THAT was painful.  LOOK FOR OVERFLASH first and trim it off BEFORE trying to fit this mask!!!!<br \/><br \/>Again, my first time with this type of latex mask and maybe my fault...doesn't take away the pain at that moment though.<br \/>Maybe a big warning on the outside of the package for people like me that just jump in and not read directions?<br \/>So, with a little trimming I got pretty much rid of that problem and then noticed the mask fit very snug across my face...yes, very snug.  Apparently, since I am a large person, and the way the mask is held on initially is the ears go over your ears it was just a bit too narrow for my liking as it sort of &#34;smushed&#34; (yes that is a technical term...look it up if you don't believe me!) my chubby cheeks together which, while not really painful or anything, was more like uncomfortable.<br \/><br \/>I may look online for some possible solutions if I find time....  I would have given a five but, do feel &#34;one size does not fit all&#34; warning should be available.<br \/><br \/>I really don't want to blame the mask and if I had invested a bit more time, I think I could have made this GREAT looking mask; since I may not invest that time I will make it a animated or static display in the &#34;haunt&#34; we are working to complete.  I don't know if it helps but, I wear a 7 1\/2 or medium hat size.  I you are a mid-sized person and a average body size this will work great!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fits perfect. Even though it looks kind of cheap and I was worried it'd fall apart, it has taken a beating and has still held together just fine - he wears it ALL the time. I was afraid the fabric for the mesh eyes would fray apart, but the fabric and stitching is strong. It's not advertised or licensed as a Deadpool mask, but looks close enough that my comic-book crazy boy is very happy with it."}

In any case it is a nice little costume and our son looks so cute it hurts! Be careful with the back Snap-On buttons. The fabric feels as it is about to rip when opening them up."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Loved the shape\/style of this top, but there was not enough\/support room in the top for me - (38 DD). With that being said, the Large was too big around, lacking the support. A Medium would have been too small in the front."}

Only problem is that the inserts sometimes wrinkle up, but that is not a big deal.

This bra is much more comfortable than the other nursing bras I have, and I plan on purchasing 2-3 more of it!"}

It is really slim, I have found myself having to check to make sure that I had it! The card slots work perfectly for me, as I do not have a ton of cards to hold. One reviewer mentioned a dislike for the owl emblem saying that it detracted from the slimness but I have not noticed it at all. The leather is really nice quality, the only gripe I could make is that it seems that is was creased and wrinkled a bit in some of the areas where it had to be folded and stitched when it was made but with some use they seem to have worked themselves out. Overall the best wallet I've ever owned and I'll look to Bellroy in the future for my wallet needs!"}

The material is not as nice as I thought it would be, its not white it is definitely ivory, and I don't really like that the material is different on the inside than on the outside so that it has to lay a certain way not to show.

We ordered 3 or them, with the handkerchiefs and for the price, they're very nice! We're using them with a darker grey suit. The contrast of the two colors is very nice. My fianc\u00e9 loves them and says they're exactly what he wanted. I would have liked something a little less bright but as long as he's happy, then I'm okay with it. The fact that they have a paisley pattern on them make them look classier than just a plain yellow satin tie."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I went for the smallest size which at the time was 34, I'm a 32 so I already knew it would be a little bit large on me. Now for the price you get very decent product, it doesn't feel like the studs will fall off easily, the material of the actual bra is thick and sturdy; it doesn't seem like it'll rip because of the weight of the studs, I would consider it the equivalent of a full coverage bra so if you are small busted like myself THAT area is completely covered, if you are more well endowed it functions well as a push up.

Material is very stretchy, light and thin but NOT cheap, see through or flimsy - extremely comfortable. I can wear this without overheating right up through the 80's F outside.

I have a bit of a belly and sewn on buttons have a tendency to break loose. That said, the sewn on button is quite sturdy, so I'm optimistic it will last. Another issue to note is Savanes tend to run long. I normally wear 34 in. length but Savane 32 in. fit perfectly. I've owned 6 pairs of Savanes (cotton wrinkle free) over the last few years and they are by far the best business casual work pants I've ever owned. They look good, they last, they are low maintenance and they are very reasonably priced."}

One button hole had not been cut so I had to open that myself, not a biggie but not great quality control there.  As long as you remember to order one size larger than you normally would, fit is basically fine.  I would normally get an L, bought this XL and fit and length is OK, EXCEPT - the sleeves attach to the body of the jacket too low at the armpit!  As a result, if you lift your arms the whole jacket rides up, you can't move your arms freely.  Personally, it's good enough for what I'll be using it for, so I'm keeping it, but I wouldn't recommend it for daily wear or to wear to a club or anything where you want to be comfortable and move freely.  I may see if a tailor can alter the sleeves for a reasonable cost."}

I wanted to prevent any possible &#34;wardrobe malfunctions&#34; that could be awkward in our busy home, where visitors are prone to walking in without warning.<br \/>  It has proven to be both secure and comfortable; so much so that my son hazarded a quick trip to a local merchant with it on (plus boots and coat).  Both son and &#34;skirt&#34; survived the trip with only one embarrassing moment, when a complete stranger was compelled to ask whether &#34;he had anything on underneath!&#34;<br \/>  Fabric is very good quality...thick and plush!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought this sweater for my 7 year old daughter for christmas with a tank to go underneath. The color I got was the orange and grey combination. I paid only 10.00 bucks for this sweater. The sweater is very stylish and beautifully made. The material is very pretty and the crochet job was nicely done and not flimsy at all. The sweater did fit my daughter a little big, but I know she will enjoy it next year. I highly recommend this sweater because it is of good quality and will look good on your child."}

I was pleased to find them here and purchased them immediately.  The only thing I noticed was even though they are made by Hanes....the Hanes Logo on the front of the bra is not on the bras I received.  I'm not sure if they are made exactly like the bra displayed on the website or not....but they are very close just NO logo.  Will order again as long as the price remains affordable.  They ARE very comfortable."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"This bra is so uncomfortable- it has no give and feels very stiff,  and the straps go out way too far towards the armpits, causing a weird gap when I sit or slouch (and I was fitted at Nordstrom, and am wearing the correct size), and dig in to my armpits.

They're a bit more expensive but they're worth it in the long run.<br \/><br \/>Update: After ordering a few additional sets of these shirts, I've noticed that there is no standard of quality with what should be the same product. Some of the shirts are produced in one country and others in another. I received a couple that had very thin cotton and would crease and wrinkle permanently at the sleeves\/hem. At least Jockey was good about allowing a return, but it is apparent that they do not incorporate any quality standards in their production.

My old Double-Dry Endurance was pretty good for this purpose but not 100% movement free. This bra does the trick. I am between a C and D and Champion C\/Ds and D's usually fit me well: this one is a D and fit is perfect. Very comfortable even for a lot of sitting trot work. 2 minor complaints: the area around the back hooks is slightly itchy when I first put the bra on, but as soon as I start my workout I don't notice it at all. In fact, once I start my workout, I'm not aware of the bra or my breasts at ALL which is exactly, what I wanted. Second, as another reviewer noted, the hang tags were attached in the seam and when I cut the plastic to remove the tags some of the plastic remained embedded in the seam. I was finally able to pull it out with tweezers but the fabric was slightly snagged. Champion: you need to find a better way to attach your tags!"}

The fabric is a little thin, see through, and clingy.  If you have back fat or any other bulges that you're trying to conceal I would skip these.

You have to really work out the hair by spreading it out. The only thing that sucks is when you spread out the hair on the black side, you can see the glue on the tips from separating so it looks like pieces of cotton in your hair. Definitely has to be worked with a while before it really looking good. Once done though, it looked great and was a hit."}

I like the pocket layout. The bottom pockets are large enough for a few tools, gloves, or nuts and bolts and chest pockets work well for my phone and glasses. I like the fact that they have large openings plus zippers or velcro so I don't have to worry about anything falling out if I take it off and lay it over the tailgate or toss it in the back seat. The main zipper is heavy duty and has large coarse teeth. This makes it harder to start and pull but I put a drop of 3in1 oil on each side of the zipper pull and worked it up and down. Seems to work better now. The elastic string that cinches the waist was too long and would foul the zipper every time. I adjusted the pinch blocks so they were against the coat when the elastic was completely relaxed, re-knotted the string at the block and cut off the excess. Seems to have solved that problem. All in all I am happy with this jacket and would recommend it."}

You have to be realistic it says &#34;slimfit&#34; just pay attention to your body type and make sure if you are busty or with wider hips you are buying the correct size.

I thought I would be  able to put it on the back of my jackets, but base on this tinny size. I'm Only able to put it on a mini and I mean mini pocket book. SMH don't wasnte ur money , not worth the $7.99"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I have to give these pants 5 stars, my only issue with the trouser is the zipper keeps going down a bit which is annoying. As for comfort, its really excellent. Its not too tight or snug. I can dance in these pants and feel really comfortable. The fabric is not scratchy, or rough.The appearence would look great in both business and casual. So its a great buy im happy with the purchase! If i could find these pants in all the colours of the rainbow hell ill buy them all."}

Normally wear an XL, based on customer recommendations I ordered a L, but went with Tall for fear the arms would be too short. That was a mistake. I should have just went with the regular large.

The description seemed to be exactly what I wanted, but some of the reviews made the fit sound a little off.  I ordered it anyway and hoped for the best.  When it arrived & I took it out of the package I was immediately impressed with the thickness & softness of the fleece.  When I put it on the fit was perfect!  I'm 5' 9&#34; & 155 lbs. & ordered the small \/ medium.  I got the navy blue & it looks great.  Exceeding my expectations, this robe is terrific."}

Quality was just as expected and decent for price."}

In my case, I knew 1 size wouldn't  be enough, so I asked for 2 sizes bigger and fitted perfectly.<br \/>I seriously recommend this!"}

I was burned twice and that is more than enough."}

They are super comfortable, help slim your tummy without making you suffer.They won't run easily, you will need to actually tear them before they run.  I can go around all day and don't feel discomforted.  I'm 5'8&#34; and my legs are very thick even then I get no irritation in my thighs after wearing them for all day.

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"The draw strings can only get so tight so they droop just a little on me, other size 36 shorts fit a little tighter at the waist.  Probably could go for a 34 and just not tie them as tight.  The drawstrings have little rubberized nubs every half-inch so they stay tied.  Shorts are super-light-weight.  Beware, there is only one pocket at your right thigh, it zips shut but the pocket's small size and the light weight of the shorts will keep you from putting all but the lightest items in that pocket.  For working out or swimming these are great."}

They did not have as much threads sticking out. The mocha is more like gray, and the seems are not very well-done, but I still liked it enough to keep it. I like the amount of sparkles in the sequence. Just subtle enough, but adds a spark. So, after all this, I thought if I ended up coming back for more and keeping it, I cannot give it 2 stars. So I changed it to 4. I think it's fair :) The customer service was nice too. They really follow up and are open to feedback."}

The flowers are also a different color and there was a print defect where half of the print on the bottom was greyed out.  Still a cute design though."}

I cannot wear them with any<br \/>of my shoes, but they are for home use anyway."}

At this price it is useless to send back it would cost me the amount that I paid for the dress to send it back. I highly recommend not to waste your money.

If it's stretched to it's limit you can see through the material. The stitching is also very good. My mother was a seamstress and I learned clothing design from her and through my school. It's also a bit rough and I can see why some people believe the material is itchy, for me though that's not the case it feels well and I'm really sensitive to material, I guess you could say my skin is picky. Overall in my perspective it's a good item."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This Fleece zip up is so much better quality than I could have ever thought possible. This has The North Face quality but not The North Face price tag. It fits spot on! I always get anxious when making a clothing purchase online. What if it doesn't fit right? Would it be a hassle to exchange, or would I just take the financial loss. My fear completely melted away as I slipped this fleece zip up on. Absolutely a perfect fit. It also has a waist cinch elastic cord to keep the cold out. I know without  doubt I have just bought my new go to cold weather pull on.<br \/>Note: The only thing I can see that would be a potential problem is the quality of the bungee clamp. Like all other zip ups and pull overs that have a waist cinch, you need to knot the elastic cord, so the clamp doesn't release and slip. This can get annoying, but like I said from my knowledge every one I have owned has done it.<br \/><br \/>*I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest unbiased review*"}

How I got there: I took the advice to use the blowdryer to pop out the nose, which made all the hair fall off (but it wasn't on that good anyways, and I would have probably had to fix it anyways), so I had to reglue the hair with superglue (recommend doing this further in advance than 10 min from having to wear it...eye stingy). I wore the belly, but couldn't get air to stay in it...not because of a hole, but because after spending a few minutes blowing it up, my hot breath steamed up the inside of the plug hole, so it would just slip out. By the end of the night though, I turned the face around, because I couldn't take the face tickling and it weirds people out when they can't see your eyes\/face. And I had to drink with a straw all night. This isn't ready right out of the box, but it still works okay."}

My ipod video slides in and out really easily, but is pretty secure when I'm running (I was worried it might jostle out of the open top somehow, but it's really not a problem).  The armband is snug, not too tight, and doesn't bounce around at all.  And I can control volume, skip songs, change playlists, etc. (basically use the control wheel through the plastic window).  All in all, it does pretty much everything you would want a little ipod holder to exercise with should do."}

The temp was about 70 degrees so even for me I was surprised how much sweat I had accrued.  I have to say, I was disappointed on the cooling front but that I do like the look of this shirt.  The crew neck and decorative stripes are very flattering and the color is divine. I am normally a Medium in most shirts but got this in a Large to keep my muffin top to myself.

Way too small. Like, I couldn't even get them buttoned. I've read that there's an astonishing amount of variation in the sizing of jeans due to manufacturing processes. The fabric shrinks at differing rates, different finishes cause the fibers to expand\/contract, seam tolerances are rather large etc. I suggest buying these in person, not over the Internet unless you know for certain what your size is."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"my baby boy is 15 pounds at 2.5 months and 3-6 month size fits him very well. so size up!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"The dress is beautiful. I got a lot of compliment however there is something with the fit in the waist part I bought a size 4 and it was big so I change for a 2 but the waist part never fit as well as the bust did.."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"As advertised"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These pants work well.  They maintain their shape and are easy to wash. They're good for anyone - but mostly for an elderly person.  Handy pockets, and easy to put on and take off.  It would be nice to have a larger color selection"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This is a very nice dress and fits like a charm. Nice color too! The only issue with mine is the \\\\\"square neck\\\\\" corner seems to be a little flappy and not stay up too well. Easy fix with a pin though. Its another keeper!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This small wallet is just the right size for me. I don't like to have a big, bulky wallet in my pocket. I normally carry 2 or 3 credit\/debit cards and a couple of membership cards along with my drivers license and of course some cash so this wallet is just the right fit.<br \/><br \/>The quality and workmanship of the wallet is pretty good and the price is just right. It is a bit tight sometimes to get a card out but otherwise I am pleased with this wallet."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I purchased the white in medium. I am 5'4, chest size 34C, about 135 lbs, I usually wear a size 6 in tops (my weight is more below the hips than above).  As others have mentioned it's a slimming fit. Not tight, but just not baggy at all. The arms are a little narrower than other jean jackets I've had, but I think it would only be a problem over a heavy sweater. I haven't had a chance to wear it yet, but size-wise, I think it'll be fine. It's cute.<br \/><br \/>When I was ordering it seemed as if there were two whites: &#34;Authentic White&#34; (which I assumed was an off white) and &#34;White&#34; (which I assumed was a whiter white, and what I was hoping for). The &#34;White,&#34; however, seems to be an off-white, so I'm not sure what the difference is. Oh well. The jacket is still cute. I'm keeping it."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love them.  I used them while I was recuperating from a stay in medical care and they were so comfortable."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"i just ordered the 9 month size of these tank top style onesies.  i first tried this product in the 3 month size and loved them and i would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for onsies to go under tank tops.  the only problem i found is that after a bunch of washes, they start to really lose their quality... however i did get a lot of use out of them.... we just do a lot of wash around here!"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Bought three shirts from Modern Kiwi, all of same description and size and they are all different.  One fits, one is way too big and the third I can fit my entire family in.  LOVE the one that fits but why aren't they consistent??  I wear between a 16-18 on clothes to give you a point of reference.  Disappointed!!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"My husband loves these cargo shorts. The cargo pockets are a good depth and placed correctly on the seam so that he can carry his iPhone 6plus without problems."}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"too small to wear - not true to size. too cheap to return."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I wear a 34 D - DD.  I bought a 34 D in this one and it looks really well under my sweaters and tops.  The only thing I did not like is that the straps are a little long.  I am up to as far short as I can get.  I am short waisted and usually have to pull up a lot of strap.  Could be a little shorter in strap for me.  BUT has a very nice flattering line under tops.  Comfy with great shaping.  I would recommend."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love the adjustable waist band. My daughter is skinny but tall so I would always have to take in her pants but with these it eliminated the need for that. They are so cute my daughter loves it too!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Delivered quick but the skulls look like aliens"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fits perfectly and looks beautiful, on."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"If you wear a size 5, the smalls will still be too big.  Trying to do Barre class in them was a nightmare!  Comfy though."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Fit correctly. Very comfortable. I would recommend. Only thing shorting this from 5 stars is additional color selection."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love them came in on time as well"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Best wallet i have ever bought. It has plenty of space for money, all kinds of cards, pictures, change, and a secret paper money place. I would say that this item is a must have for any man who needs a replacement wallet. I give it a 10 out of 10."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I am wearing this for my new years party and it is very cute. however it is so tight i have to wear black leggings underneath. it is very cute but order one size up!!! the sleaves also are short"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The material is not what I expected. I thought also the color was olive green and it was not even close. The material was too thin and see through.  I read that it was more comfortable. I should have bought the same exact material as the gray one that I bought at the same time. I am not a person that likes to return things. But I will probably ask the company that sent this to me if they can send me one equivalent to the gray one. Other than that it came in on time."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Unwearable! The top is way too small, stitched all wrong, lopsided, gathered in spots that shouldn't be, sleeves that are almost to my knees, color is off white, not white, and all together a waste of money. I ignored all the bad reviews because the top was so cute. I won't make that mistake again."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"the best of all"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My son loved the shirt so much he thought I had designed it and wanted me to sell them lol. He received many compliments. I would def plan ahead on ordering as some colors are limited in size and\/or color. Fit true to size."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fits very well and has a very good price-quality ratio. I will buy an other one because they are very comfortable."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"These came with a lot of padding with an extra bump at the bottom. It is not removable. Not removable it may be too much."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"comes in handy when you buy a hat (like a victorian touring hat) that is to big.  easy to install around the inside of the brim and makes the hat fit to perfection.  sent to me quickly.  i recommend the seller to anyone."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Good deal nice shirt"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Very comfy!  However, I ordered the 8-9y size for my 10 going on 11 average height, skinny boy.  I tried to get my hands inside to see how they felt (I'm a petite 2 with shorter fingers) and they fit ME beautifully!!  Very soft on the inside and it was the first snow glove I've tried on that my fingers actually went to the end of the finger tips. He tried them on and said they were great, though the fingers were way too long for him.  I came back to order the next size down, but it's not currently available.  He loved the neon yellow saying &#34;I'll be able to find them now!!&#34;.  I'm sure we'll fight over them next time it snows.<br \/><br \/>Anyhow, just 4 stars due to size being so far off, but more importantly, we haven't actually tested them yet!  If by chance I remember when we get the chance in 9-10 months, I'll update this review...."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This cardigan looks nice on, and is well-made and durable.  I wear it all the time.  I would recommend it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Sturdy.  Well made.  Like most belts, it is undersized...if you really are a 56 waste, then get larger if available"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"its ok, they are very pretty and arrived in a fairly decent amount of time but they are a bit small"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"but well made.  There is a headband and a necklace included.<br \/>The company refunded me quickly when I returned it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought this dress in a small in the summer plum color and it's great.  I'm 5'7&#34; and 145 lbs.  I sometimes take a M in Neon Buddha, but not in this dress;  it fits well over the bust line and drapes down nicely, just skimming the body.  I'm glad it hides my bit of belly.  I'm planning to take this dress travelling to Europe.  It will dress up or down and be super comfortable because of the stretch in the fabric.  I'm super happy with this purchase."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It's an awesome design and it came before it said it would"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"great deal"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"I ordered the dress planning on pairing it with similar colors for my children for a photo and the dress I recieved is NOTHING like pictured, wasn't even close!!!!  So upset about this and not enough time to get a new one"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I love the print and the size of this tote. I use it for school and it fits about 3 to 4 (med sized) books and my macbook air. Plus, its tall so can fit stuff like my makeup bag or lunch bag on top of the books with plenty of room. My only issue with this bag is that there is nothing from stopping your stuff from falling out at the top (maybe I should have looked for a zipper bag). Also, I didn't like the bottom of the bag has no board so if you don't put some type of cardboard your stuff sinks down and makes the bag look really droopy. I love the inside clear pocket because I'm usually that person that has to take everything out to find my stuff so a clear pocket is a great help! This bag, I think, was good for the price."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I bought this jacket to replace a 3 year old similar jacket. This jacket fits great and has worked as expected. There isn't a liner but I kew that and don't need it for real cold temperatures. A great jacket for when there us a chill in the air."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Colour, fit and fabric is beautiful."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The fabric is soft and conforms to my body perfectly.  I was a little worried about the length being too long but because the fabric clings to you, it doesn't look ugly...instead it looks sexy and classy!<br \/><br \/>Thank you for this and i will be buying another in a different color!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This comfy top is nice quality, better than expected for the price in fact. Casual but a little sassy. Glad I bought it. This is the second top I purchased from this company and both are terrific!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"We have truck-theme Fridays and these were a perfect addition.  They were a little stiff at first, but have washed well so far."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"nice bet ....."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Not overly big for an XL, but it actually fits like it should. Not sure it matters, but I'm 6ft, 195 lbs. Shirt is quite soft and should work out well for my holiday parties"}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Sizes run so small I ordered a size larger than what my son currently wears and it still didn't fit !!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Somewhat large but it's quite comfortable. The white color fabric is thin and kinda see thru."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I enjoyed wearing these they are long and fits neat."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Good button\/snap-up sleeper. I love that designer used gold (color) snaps at the center snap between legs (vs silver color for rest of sleeper) to help differentiate when fastening. Making it less likely to mess up snap pairing. The snaps aren't as easy to attach as I would like but worth it since it looks cute on my little one!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I have had these socks for about 3-4 months and they haven't faded or torn in any way. They are still black unlike most other brands that carry black socks. They fit perfectly and don't slide off your feet when walking. I am a size 10.5. I will definitely buy more of these in the near future."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love this shirt, will be ordering more"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This is a very comfortable bra, it runs a little large around the body but still fits very comfortably on tightest clips on back.  Cups fit correctly.  It was delivered on time and it was priced right.  I would buy this bra again from this vendor."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"This swimsuit has no torso. I am short at 5'3 with 38ddd cups. The cups fit but the torso was so short that it pulled my breasts down to a sagging position and this pulled from the crotch. It was very very awkward. Also the white lining could be seen through the blue suit. I guess that's what I get for buying a cheap swimsuit!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great coat.... Lightweight and stylish!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great Levi's jean, good quality and fits perfect, almost tailor-made for me."}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"I bought several pairs of pjs and the two I bought of this style are going to be donated.  The waistline is way too low. The material is very thin.  I'm usually a size 10 or 12 at most, so I bought a large and they were still snug.  I'd take a pass on these, unless you are a very skinny teen who wears her pants below her butt!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Too many"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I bought this for my 12 month old for a wedding. The fabric of the shorts felt like fabric for casual wear. I just made him wear it as everyday summer wear. The vest was a bit more dressy. I ended up peering the vest with other pieces that I purchased elsewhere. The shirt and bow tie  I thought were cheap looking too. The hat will never stay on 12 months old head so that's a waste. Overall I wouldn't recommend for a formal or classy occasion."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Got this today for my son and nephew for Christmas I bought two of them one black and grey I will say get a size bigger it run small but it look nice"}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"not recommended,  bad materials not buy"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I needed a new coat when I found this London Fog. It is a great coat. Very warm, rain resistant and long enough to keep your backside warm and dry. Well made as a London Fog is known for. Very pleased with the coat, arrived on time and at a very good price."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great hat"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great price, buy it off their website thru amazon. It so much cheaper that at store like Macys. (even with their silly 29% adn $5.00 coupons )<br \/>Good fit, comfortable material  and that's it!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Good,  better than average,  material; better than average stiching... pockets are placed in a funky sort of manner but accerptable; cut smaller thru the waist than expected but i am larger in the waist than i would wish to be so that is not the coat's fault but it is cut tight so take that into conseration if ordering. i have short arms and the sleves are generously long so i rolled up the cuffs; not bad but just saying so you will take that also into consideration also. Now ... the odd thing... people comment on it and it is such a vanilla , no attention getting jacket , but people ask me about it; where i got it? that sort of  thing.... go figure."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"A teenagers size. And the cheapest material I've ever seen. Will never wear"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love this v-neck tank.  I ordered a &#34;small&#34; and I think it runs true to size.  It fits well.  I like the design which allows my arms to be free and unrestricted when I exercise and lift weights.  I would order it again.  It washes well."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This is my second bra by Rosme, these demi cups fit me perfect and the shoulders stay up beautifully!  I would buy more but they never have my size (40B) available!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"i bought it for my husband. very similar to the one he already had but newer. it holds most everything from credit cards and money and other small things. the leather feels real and i hope it last a good 2or 3 years."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"There is no adjustable waist. Definitely next summer! Great color!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Well, I wish the shipping had been free.  I only bought these through Amazon because I live a 3 hour drive from decent shopping.  However, these are great wind pants.  I live at 7,000 feet elevation on the I-80 corridor of Wyoming and the wind hardly stops.  I walk to work year around and pull these over my dress pants this winter.  I bought the XXL and wish I had the XL.  I wear a 37 waist pant and 32 inseam for dress pants and a 36x34 for jeans if that helps you guess the right size for you."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I would say order again in other colors if they had them."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"they fit nicely and look great either matched or mixed (since I am most often matching sox that is very important to me)"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I got these shirts and the Gerber side snap shirts. These were so much nicer. The material is soft and thick. Worked great for those first few weeks. The only downside, is they tend to ride up, but that can't really be avoided with the t-shirts compared to onsies."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Seems to run very large"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Lasted for a good while then the pockets started ripping.  It seems like the shorts are a thin material so they will rip easily, other than that the look and the feel were great.  I would order more."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"These were the best elastic waist pull ons that I have tried."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Slinky fabric.  Shows all the imperfections but with spanx looks good"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Good."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The fit was a little big but it was great! The shirt was high quality. It wasn't one of those paper thin shirts with a blurry image. It was a clear crisp image on high quality material. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"First off, this wallet was larger than I expected.  I wish it had about half its thickness.<br \/><br \/>I have now had this for 8 months and have used it every day.  It has completely fallen apart.  The plastic card holder on the inside has ripped apart, the clasp hardly holds together, and the final breaking point was the hinges.  8 months was to short of a time for this wallet."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My grandson loves this outfit! Its comfortable and stylish. Neck opening was a bit tight so I just stretch it out good before putting it on him. Its his favorite!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very nice robe.  It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be, which is a plus in my book.  About the only thing I could see as a problem is that although the robe is quite generous and roomy, the waist tie could be a bit short for the more generously proportioned in the waist area."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Given as a gift. It seemed a little small at first, but the person it was for says it fits fine."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"nice...not too bad"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Not as described took about 30 days to get here"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Seems to be more like the &#34;relaxed&#34; fit. I only ordered one pair to determine size needed. I have washed and dried; still too large. I will try smaller size."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Strong, supportive, well worth my money."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love it"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I really like the hat because it is lined with satin to help keep hair neat looking longer. This hat can be worn by all hair types. However, it is not worth the almost $40.00 price tag."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The size 8 fit skin tight on my youngest daughter , who wears size 6. I imagine it would be a size 4 after I washed it.  We used the easy return policy and have reordered a 12. It is pretty, however, regardless of the size."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Other than being a bit thin, my son says they are comfortable and relatively warm.  Good price, decent sock.  If they don't wear out too quickly, I will probably purchase them again."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Bad product in terms of fitting and tailoring . The colorbleeds on washing .There is no warning n the label to wash separately. The pants shrunk a few inches with washing."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought these in black over a year ago and they still look like new (no fading, pilling, or excessive shrinkage). They are also very soft and moderately padded on the soles.  I love these so much that I'm ordering several more, in black and white!"}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"ok"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Top fits well, comfortable.  Very hard to find an athletic swimsuit top that isn't teeny tiny but this one provides full coverage and excellent support.  Very comfortable and solid construction"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Yes it's plastic, not wood but it's a great prop and the top glowing orb is great...very happy with the appearance of this product."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great belt, nice price.  Using it for a couple months now and no cracks, however like all belts it has some wear along the area where the buckle holds it.  But very fancy, and just as shiny as the picture shows."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"It's slim fit and light silver-grey tall man. I wouldn't return it because it still looks good, a bit different. The chest area is a little snug but other parts of the shirt fit well for a 48 chest and 38\/40 waist. The material keeps you cool but it gets wrinkled all over easily. I'm not sure where to wear this shirt; probably at a beach party or kept under a blazer."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"After reading the reviews on this one, I just ordered it a size down for my 5 year old, and it fits perfectly! Looks really cute  - just as portrayed in the picture!!! We love it!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This company was very easy to deal with. The shirt came sooner than I expected and it is a high quality shirt with beautiful graphic. I ordered the turquoise shirt and it is a perfect shade of turquoise. Not at all dull, but not overly  bright. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size. When I went to see what I could do about a refund, they gave me a prepaid label so I didn't have to pay for return shipping. I thought that was very generous. I have had to return other items in the past to other companies and most of the time, the shipping charges are deducted from my refund. I would definitely order from this company again. 5 Stars for sure!!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Just what I wanted!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"After I got it, I noticed there were some stains inside the wallet and the wallet is dirty. Also, the card slots are so tight that it is hard to put cards inside of them and it's hard to take cards out. It looks good though."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I can't say enough about the clothing line from 4-rth.  Great material, fit and overall excellent line.  The detailed stitching were an extra perk.  I have several shorts and tanks.  The tank is definitely a slim fit but feels great and never loose.  I'm a Yoga teacher and live in my 4-rth shorts and tanks.  The material is giving.  I'm 6'1, 160lbs and slim - I use medium. Great fit \/ snug.  I teach hot yoga so it's important my clothes don't stick or droop during specific postures.  I will definitely purchase more from this company.  The price is fine - like anyone, i always want to pay less for something great - but consider the junk out there like ll-lemon at twice the price, 4-rth has my business from now on."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My cousin and I purchased these for our upcoming trip to Europe.  I usually wear a ten or 12, but I like to have room in my tops and jackets, so I ordered a large. It fit perfectly, feels great and looks very nice.  My cousin wears about the same size and ordered a medium.  She loved the way it felt and looked but couldn't zip it, but she never zips her jacket so she decided to keep her medium.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and am so anxious to wear it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Bought this in the blue color. Loved the shade of blue! It arrived on the day that it was promised to arrive! Top is surprisingly secured, even without the strap! Bottom was a bit small, but it should fit fine after a little bit of exercise. Would definitely purchase from the seller again. :-)"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This hat definitely does the job of keeping sun out of my face. The bow tie on the back Velcro is very cute. It does not mess up hairstyles. However, buyers should note that the front brim in very large. This is definitely for sun protection and not necessarily style. Serves its purpose."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"I was disappointed when the \\\\\"eye\\\\\" fell off the next day. I had to glue it again. The \\\\\"fingers\\\\\" came off so easily, I did not even notice. Basically, this item disintegrated in my hands. Looks like it is made of metal but it is more fragile than cardboard."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"this is a beautiful ring but the bad thing is that I feel like the gem is not that stuck to the ring but it hasn't fallen out so that is good. I do recommend it. I got two and I gave the another one to my friend and she loved it. it does not make your finger green. well I hope this helped people thinking about buying this ring."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Just got my dress. The back is very unusual and i love how they included a pad so i dont need a bra. It is true to fit just very long. It is dragging on the floor, otherwise it is perfect. Good buy."}

What I got was a \\\\\"scrap jacket\\\\\" with a huge eagle patch on the back along with the words USA sewn onto it."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fits just perfect. Made well and are very comfortable. Would buy more in different colors such as white, Navy Blue, and Dark Brown. Would round out summer wardrobe nicely."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This is the only sweatshirt my husband buys, not only for himself but for his crew, as well. He gets the company logo embroidered on them because they wear for a very long time. This sweatshirt gets a lot of abuse while on the job. His employees wear these sweatshirts all winter, climbing up in attics and\/or working in crawl spaces under houses. When I go outside to do chores, the first thing I grab is my husband's sweatshirt. It's warmer than my hooded coat!  This sweatshirt always looks nice after being laundered. It's comfortable, has good quality material, and the lining is a thermal weave which really helps when the frigid wind blows. Although this is pricier than a discount store sweatshirt, this one will last a long time, won't shrink, and will withstand many washings."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Returned, squared shoulder pads were terrible. Too low\/big in the chest. Not for me. Sequins were lovely though, ordered a different style."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Loved the dress.  Too small  based on my regular size."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Fits a little shorter than I expected, and the shelf bra is a little short with a normal bra underneath. But the fabric is very soft and stretches nicely around my pregnant belly, ended up ordering more cuz I like them so much!"}

I am a big girl about 240-250 my size is between an 18-20 and it works well it just depends on your standards of fabric it's soft but it's nothing special. BUT for like 5 dollars this thing was awesome! My boyfriend absolutely loves it on me ;)The underwear that came with it is crap the string in the back was long it dangled like it was made for a sumo butt and and the front was really small and on a big girl it looks like your lady bits swallowed the cloth! they just kept getting twisted and i couldnt untwist them so I tossed them."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Our granddaughter loves these PJs. Very comfortable and oh so cute."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Perhaps it's my fault for not reading the specs, but the item was larger than I had expected. However, it looks exactly as pictured, shipped very quickly, and the seller sent an extra free button and a note. It has also held up very well after many accidental washings."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"It's a really nice graphic tee , don't expect a smooth print though, the look of it is more like a fine newspaper print but that is the design, the print is holding up well. The design is a nice large print, trust me people will spot the \\\\\"Quiksilver\\\\\" from miles away. All in all very satisfied with this product."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Looks and feels good. Great buy"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"At first I was very pleased with this sock as it was made of a nice thick warm material. Seemed liked it was going to last a long time and keep my feet warm during the winter season. I wore this sock a total of 3 times before I took my shoe off and noticed a tear on the top where my big toe is. This was very disappointing."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Surprisingly high quality! I bought a Dalmatian suit; The big nose is absolutely adorable and the white spandex is thick enough to not be translucent (as often white spandex is). It's just tight enough around the spots that matter, and has not ripped anywhere after several uses. Highly recommended for those into this sort of thing!"}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Im 6'3 215 lbs I ordered size 2XL going off the product image, I thought it was slim fit, yet it droops like a curtain."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I wear a Large in US size and i read that it runs small so i ordered a XL in US size and it fits me like a regular large. It is slim fit as well. Dont listen to the negative reviews about being to small. Theyre like those people that dont read directions in the test so they end up failing. In this case they didnt order their size carefully and the shirt ended up being too small. Im 5'10 weighing at 187 pounds. Bulky yet slim physique. I ordered the XXL-Asian\/XL-US. This fits me like a US Slim Fit Large. Hope this helps."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The product exceeded my expectations for Sure.  It stretches very nicely and is very true to the size it indicates.  The color and fabric are high quality, especially for the price; I am extremely pleased.  It's sturdy and it also looks good. what a great buy for me!"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"they look great.  fit good.  comfortable<br \/>washed and hung to dry--pants are now too short.<br \/>I didn't even put them in the drier.  For this reason<br \/>I would never buy another one."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Made me look like a Baggy sac of potaotes. Not a great suit for short torso curvy girls, unless your wanting to hide a belly, I thought it made me look bigger."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. I knew what she wanted. Real silk. Good quality. Pretty style. It is all 3. It's not so sheer as to be too revealing, however, as several of the earlier reviews have indicated, the camisole runs a little large in the arm\/bust. Good thing my wife is an excellent sewer. She'll alter it and be happy to wear it. Might get her another."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Nice and comfortable fabric; good looking. The only problem is the fabric tends to pill easily. My husband is wearing a cloth arm sling, and where the sling touches the shirt, the material has pilled heavily. May not be a problem were it not for the sling. Would buy again."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Runs teeny tiny!! I sent it back."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The skirt was delivered within 5 days of the order, neatly folded and just as pictured. The material is just thick enough with quality stitching. After a wash I simply hung it to dry and it retained its shape wonderfully. I normally wear a small but decided on a medium to allow room for my bottom. It fits perfectly! I ordered the brown and liked it so much I purchased the red as well.<br \/>I will be wearing this skirt for work and snappy casual outings."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I wore out my favorite jacket and needed a quick affordable replacement for a family function. I didn't know what to expect ordering online. I usually like to touch the fabric and look at the construction of the jacket. I took a chance after reading some of the reviews. When I received it I was pleasantly surprised.<br \/><br \/>It was something I would probably have picked out myself. The jacket was light enough to wear on a warm night. The sleeves and jacket length were proportionate to the size so alteration weren't a concern.<br \/><br \/>Now how long the jacket will last I have no idea as I haven't had it long enough, but the construction seems adequate. I was able to socialize with friend and family without much fuss as the performance was quite impressive. I was able to run around with my nieces and nephews, posing for family photos and cutting the rug on the dance floor. At the end of the night I took off the jacket and it didn't seem any worse for wear and tear. What I mean is the jacket wasn't falling apart, no loose threads, no stains, and no odor. I'm sure if I take care of it, it should last me quite a long time.<br \/><br \/>I would give the jacket a buy recommendation, for the price you won't be sorry. I wasn't!"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Withing one day all the seams began getting holes in them. I trashed it needless to say. It's cute but the durability is lacking."}

{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"The picture and description showed a green shirt with a silk screen. it actually was a white T-Shirt with an iron on decal. not at all what I was expecting or had anticipated on ordering. very disappointed."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Arrived very quickly with prime. Wig and beard are very similar to pic, but eyebrows are not included. Will just have to grow my own out next time. Shouldn't take more than a week or so anyway. One piece of advice, adjust the moustache portion so the center is lined up with your nose or you will look like you have a crooked face! Also, do not attempt to eat with this bad boy or you risk choking on plastic hairs for days."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These Pajamas were purchased for my mom's 80th birthday.  She loved them.  They fit perfectly.<br \/>She loved the color.  They were delivered on the date I was told they would.  It made her birthday<br \/>and it made my day as well.  It was so nice to see her so happy."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I ordered this skirt in a small.  I run about a 5\/6 in jeans, but have a fairly round booty.  The small was a bit too snug in that area, although it fit well in the waist, no muffin top or tight squeezing.  I returned and got the medium, which fit perfectly.  The skirt sits right above the hip and below the belly button.  I wore a beige sports jacket, beige heels and a white tank and it looked very pulled together.  The skirt is a good weight for the impending summer heat.  The material is soft but not too thin.  Coral was true to color.  I'm ordering another in royal blue and grey.  These are easy everyday office wear skirts.  Highly recommend if you are a skirt girl on a budget!"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"They are not soft around the neck and they are too tight. I have to constantly pull on them to release the tightness around the neck. I am quite disappointed with the way they irritate my neck."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"HOWEVER, this was missing a piece as I ordered it. They offered a small refund but should have comp'd the entire purchase. This is definitely cheaply made so any slight movements or if it fits too tightly or something catches on the material it easily comes apart. I would have rated this higher if all pieces were received."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Socks fit as expected. Wool is very warm without being too bulky. Fits great in work boots. I bought these for snowmobiling in Minnesota."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I get compliments EVERY time I wear this awesome suit. The color is perfect, exactly what I wanted. I have a 30&#34; waist and like my clothing to fit me, so I had the sides of the jacket brought in just a bit- but it didn't need much, and that was only $15 to do.<br \/><br \/>The material is a good quality too- it's not flimsy like I would expect for the price.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These run a tiny teeny bit large but, they are comfortable and look nice. They need to be washed first, because otherwise they are a teeny bit stiff and rub at the knee seems. I am going to buy these in khaki and wear as regular summer pants. They have a bit of style."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"They run a little large. The material is fine but not really wonderful."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Cheaply made but for the price it should be expected. The flowers fell off and the bow on the tux was not positioned properly. The so called veil was wrinkled and had several small holes along the seam. Not major problems but lots of little ones that make it not worth it. Plus the sizes run small for a baseball hat. I had plans to customize the hats anyway, so I was not too annoyed but I would've bought a more expensive one and decorated them myself."}

It came in the mail three days after I ordered it with regular shipping :) She is about 12 lbs and it looks like it will fit perfectly right now but its pretty stretchy so I expect she will be able to wear it for a while. I was a little worried due to a few other reviewers saying theirs did not have straps, but mine did so maybe the seller fixed that issue? It is SO cute, the quality is great especially considering the price, and I can't wait to put her in it. The only thing I would love is if it had snaps on the bottom so that I could change her diaper without having to take the whole outfit off. I will definitely buy another in the next size up as she grows."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I LOVE these knit caps soooo much I had to write a review. I've got a slightly big head (literally not figuratively! I wear a fitted hat of 7 1\/2) so some knit hats I have fit a little tight and if I wear the cap for a long period of time my ears start to ache. I just can't stand that! So I've been looking for a hat that fits loose but not  too lose and will stay on my head. This cap was perfect. It fits well enough so it doesn't drop down around my eyes and is definitely loose enough that I can wear it all day without it hurting my ears. I ended up buying a couple more in different colors! The fabric is a little light so I don't know if the hat will be good for super cold days but I've been wearing it in sub zero weather to work the past few days here in Ohio and it's been just fine. I actually like that the fabric isn't too thick so I can just leave the hat on when I get where I'm going and I'm not burning up when I'm inside. LOVE these caps!! Did I say that yet? :) I read some people say the cap is smaller than the pic. Looking at that mannequin head I'd say the cap fits my head a little bit snugger than what is pictured but it's by no means tight on my head. So a word of caution there. I do wish they showed a couple of real people with different size heads to get a good idea of how the cap fits different people. Oh well. Anyway, love it. Very satisfied with my purchase!"}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Just received this shirt and very disappointed. I'm a size 43 chest so I got the Large. The reason I got this is I have a small \\\\\"pooch\\\\\". I also have a well developed chest. The shirt flattened out my chest and did nothing for my pooch. So now I still have a small stomach but no shape to my chest. Look much better without it. So I'd recommend this only for guys with gyno issues, as it won't fix anything else. And it's extremely tight so don't order smaller than your size, you won't get it on."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"To begin, I have thighs that would impress Earl Campbell so finding boxer briefs that don't migrate north is a real challenge.  I liked the Adidas Ultra Stretch until they changed the formula and have been trying to find a suitable replacement ever since.  These guys stay where they're supposed to and are very comfortable.  The only minor negative I have is that they don't breathe a ton and are pretty warm, especially when worn while working out.  This is a minor enough of a nitpick that it didn't drop my rating below 5 stars and I will be buying more of these shortly.<br \/><br \/>I've tried at least 15 different brands\/styles of underwear over the last year trying to find a replacement for my Adidas Ultra Stretches.  These Champion are by far the best I've found."}

He said they do work well.<br \/><br \/>I was quite embarrassed to give him these as a surprise gift as the package that arrived was NOT as what is shown on the product page. The bandanas were not in their original package. The bandanas were stuffed inside a folded receipt and stuffed in a padded envelope and just looked cheap and ridiculous. Seriously?! That's how you send out a product?! I will not buy from Haynesville Distribution again."}

It arrived timely and packaged beautifully but when I took it out, I discovered the fabric was so thin it was transparent.

I didn't anticipate the length so more research will be done before I buy another one."}

So first of all, the other reviewers were not kidding when they said these things are sheer, like so sheer you could see right through them to my underwear haha. They are definitely more like tights than leggings so don't think you will be able to wear these with just a tunic...definitely has to be with dresses or at least a very long tunic. That being said, they are super adorable and a great way to try the bandage trend on the cheap. They fit about as I expected, I'm short at only 5'2 and they aren't too long on me and not uncomfortably tight or anything.<br \/><br \/>So long as you know what you are getting into, I recommend these!"}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The belt arrived early by a few days. I am very happy with it so far. The only thing is I wish I had ordered the XL instead of the L belt because it is the exact length described 38 inches total for the Large. So if your a 32-34 a L would be perfect size for you. An if your 36-38 go with the XL so you have a little extra belt at the end I am 36 and have 3 inches after belt is on. Other then that I like the way the belt fits BUT it is very POOR quality material. I will be NOT be buying more items from this seller in the future. I would NOT recommend this seller to anyone who wants a good quality product.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: I have now had the belt for a little over three weeks and one of the Eyelets has already come out and the belt is fraying around the other Eyelets.  I will maybe get another two weeks out of the belt before it falls apart all together. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLERS PRODUCTS!<br \/>."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Good costume for the money.  Not sure how to wear the &#34;gold leaves&#34; in my hair.  While the bracelets and belt were a little big, they are easily adjustable with safety pins or a little more adhesive-backed velcro.  The cape is neat and really adds to the outfit, but it is heavy enough relative to the tunic that it makes it ride up to my neck in front.  I will figure something out to make it more comfortable.  Still looking for the appropriate sandals to pair with this outfit as they are not included with this costume."}

I washed and put this t-shirt in the dryer until dry. Shrinkage was minimal to none.  T-shirt is not a heavy cotton neither is it a thin cotton.  I bought this particular t-shirt because I like Elvis (obviously) but also because I did not want a t-shirt that was marketed more towards a woman than a man.  Overall great quality t-shirt, great price with nice graphic.  Also, this t-shirt is officially licensed by Elvis Presley Enterprises.  You can't go wrong."}

This whip looks pretty great for the price. I got it on sale at the time. I am excited to get the rest of my costume to see if it fits well with the whip. It does actually crack. I have done it a few times today just playing around with it. The handle is a little uncomfortable as it is a little tight but I think it is just for you to be able to hang it on a belt. So for that purpose it works fine. Overall I am so far happy with this purchase."}

{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"I purchased 5 sets of these scrubs after being extremely happy with the Natural Uniforms Contrast Trim scrub sets. I was soo disappointed with these! They do run a size larger, but it states that right on the product description, so it wasn't really an issue for me. These were a way thinner material that the other scrubs I had purchased from this company, even though both items state they are 65\/35 Poly\/Cotton. I initially wasn't bothered by this because I tend to be a little warm blooded but they are not holding up well at all! I have worn them maybe 3 or 4 times and they are starting to pill where my arms brush against my chest during work. The stitching isn't reinforced so don't feel that they are going to hold up well with continued wear. I have had one pair rip at the seams in the crotch when I was bending down playing with my son.  I really wish they had been as nice as the other contrast trim sets that I purchased, if I could return them I would, but they have been worn and laundered so now I'm stuck with them. I'm not sure why there is such a difference in these two scrubs from the same company but I wish that I wouldn't have wasted my money on these. :("}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I would give this jacket 5 stars, but the coat isnt perfect, but very good. It is warm, fits according to size. (I am 5'8, 135, and a slim build and it fits quite well.) Let me say, if you are a relatively big guy and have big shoulders, this jacket would not fit proportionally because it is a little tight fitting along the shoulders. The amount of pockets are very well placed. The jacket has feathers lined inside which makes it pretty warm in the cold winter. The jacket slides past the waist but it is rather mobile. The double zipper deal is kind of a pain, because you have to take your time zippering the jacket, but the snaps can work just as well. The sleeve length is pretty proportional. The hood fur is pretty good, although the hood is pretty big, and would only recommend you wear it if you really wanted to keep warm. The jacket is stylish, and for the price, you cannot beat the quality. If anyone has any questions, let me know."}

The knitting on socks are flexible and molds to your foot while giving you the space you need when landing on your when running.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I absolutely LOVE the bottoms! I am 5'4&#34; with a long torso and not so long legs. I have always had a bit of a booty with wide hips, and a smallish bust. After having 2 children, I now have stretchmarks.  With all of that going on, I needed something modest but still stylish and sexy. Because I read all of the reviews and most saying it runs quite small, I ordered a XXL. The bottoms on these are perfect! The high waist reaches the perfect height, and most importantly for me, the bottom part of the bottoms fully covers my cheekies and hides my &#34;side booty&#34;\/saddlebags so nicely. It is so flattering. Most high waist bathing suit bottoms are cut differently and not as low on the sides. I bought one from Forever21 and I wear it often, however I am always self conscious about my &#34;side booty&#34; sticking out (lack of better term). So excited that these solve my problem!<br \/><br \/>Since, like I said before, I have a smallish bust, the top was waaaaaaay too big for me. Useless, unfortunately! I wish these were sold in separates. The quality of the top is great though. I love these bottoms so much I'm buying it again in a small size so I can have a matching top that fits!<br \/><br \/>Well worth the price."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This is a lovely dress and fits perfect. I ordered the sm and it looks like it was custom made. The only problem are the black marks. One right in the middle of the front and 2 on each side of the bust. They look like black markers and I will wash and hope they come out. I am not too concerned about the side marks, but the one in front, I noticed as soon as I took it out of the package and held it up. I ordered the Navy and it is lovely. I am not a big fan of uncovered upper arms, but I will match with a nice silky shawl and it will look fab. I wear a size 8 and have 36D bust. At 5'6&#34; the dress hits me just above the ankles. I would give it 5 stars except for the black mark on the front. Bummer"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"As soon as I received my first pair and tried them on, I immediately ordered two more. They fit as expected (I'm 6'3&#34;\/225 lbs. and bought size L), snug enough not to bunch up beneath my work slacks, loose enough that I can comfortably wear them all day. I'm not sure they'd be the right choice for all-day exposure to deep cold, but they work just fine for me (I live in Chicago and I take two trains and a bus to work, so spend a fair amount of time outside during my commute). For the price, they seem like a great bargain to me."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It has an odd fit. Maybe the material isn't best for larger busts (for reference, I'm a 34D) because it bunches out at the armpits\/breast area. It does ride up due to the stretchy material. But the print is cute and the colors are vibrant. Not my favorite shirt but I'll keep it as a work-out tank, as it is very breathable."}

I've got black and the deep red color to wear around Christmas-time. Before I found these I had ordered a 'regular' pair of dark blue by D&K Monarchy and they were awful. They were thin and cheap and 'pilled' as soon as they came in contact with anything.  They (the D&K  ones) aren't fit to wear with anything except under a flannel nightgown where they can't be seen. I'm so happy to have found these thick ones from My House of Chic!!"}

I had previously purchased an unlined pair and love them also but with the colder weather needed something that is lined.  I've had them on for a few minutes and they are already feeling like they were custom tailored to my hands.  This is a high quality good and I've bought leather gloves before, however, they've not been as butter soft as these.  Can't wait to put them on my leather wrapped steering wheel."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"My one year old daughter has eczema and would constantly try to scratch her face, which often results in bleeding! During daytime I closely monitor her to prevent her from scratching, but she would scratch when sleeping at night. My experience with mittens is like other reviewers': none of them stay on. When my husband found Guavamitts we were so excited and immediately ordered 2 pairs. Until now we've been using them for almost 2 months and I've noticed the following problems with them:<br \/>1. The edges of the cute red tags on the mitts are scratchy! I had to remove all of them, which is not an easy task because they are tightly sewn on.<br \/>2. I think the double-sided patterns are unnecessary, and the 2 layers of fabric in addition to the fabric of the mitts per se actually cause extra drying time for the mitts after laundering.<br \/>3. BIGGEST ISSUE: When we tighten the mitts around my daughter's wrists, there is a large portion at the end of the sticky band (not sure how to say it in English, hope people understand what I'm talking about...) left exposed, which would stick to her bedding or clothing and sometimes loosen the mitts and cause them to fall off!<br \/>So, although I really like the idea of Guavamitts, I think there is large room for improvement."}

I was afraid I wouldn't be able to go on the trip because of my Reynaud's, but this product (as well as others I purchased here) allowed me to go and have a memorable and positive experience with fewer bouts of the super-intense discomfort I get when my fingers go through a Reynaud's cycle.<br \/><br \/>I can't vouch for long-term quality, because I only really used them heavily for about 2 days, but they stood up to all that use while I was in the intertidal (and I was crawling on rocks and touching all sorts of things). All I can say is that the purchase was worth it for me."}

The wide white stripe in the back is directly over my butt (of which I have a very round one, so if you like extra attention back there this is positive) so you have to be careful which underwear you wear. The other thing is the lining on the inside is shorter than the rest of the dress, so it is a little more tricky to get into and also can ride up a little more than the dress itself.

I have a 27.5&#34; waist and wished I could've tightened it more because it hung just slightly, but if you check out my photos the cinch still looks good. I'm sure with more layering underneath it wouldn't be as much of an issue. clasp felt cheap though and was hard to secure<br \/>-considering all the moving around I was doing posing for photos I didn't feel nearly as warm as I would hope for a solid winter jacket<br \/><br \/>I think if you're looking for a shorter semi-winter coat to maybe get you through November (in Boston) this would be worth your time to try out.

From some of the negative reviews I've seen about the color being wrong or it fading, I don't quite understand. Like I said, when it came in it looked exactly how it does in the picture. And for the fading, obviously they don't know how to properly wash a shirt with a print on it. It's kinda common sense to turn shirts with a print on in inside out when you wash it, but I guess everyone doesn't know that."}

It came with a matching wrap, which I used as a swatch for a more substantial jacket.  Delivery was speedy.  The size (2X) fit about a 16 and was a bit busty for me, but the seamstress found it easy to alter.  Would be a bit long for a petite -- perfect tea length for average height.

So, that must be their warning that it will shrink. Yet the tag says machine wash cold and low dryer. I will be contacting Amazon so the description is changed."}

The leather is thick and the seams all seem to be strong.  The zipper is a bit weak but then I've only had it a week.  This is well worth the money and one week it took to get here.  This is a winter weight jacket so don't expect to wear it during the summer."}

These were a great fit (note: he's very slim and the legs are very slim-fitting) and the denim was not too relaxed; they felt like Levis of old, slightly stiffened. The colour was a good choice; sort of smokey charcoal, not blue, not black, and looked fine with a dress shirt. Excellent price too."}

It looks really cool and the zipper works well. However, the price is outrageous. It's a durable hoodie and decent thickness, but normally I would never pay so much for a hoodie.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I bought three Doublju shirts in one go, my first experience with the company, but having owned similar shirts from Asian companies before. This shirt was definitely my favorite of the three. The material is soft and stretchy, thick enough to feel substantial, but not heavy. The stripe is a separate piece of fabric stitched into the shirt, and the stitching seems quite solid. The stripe goes all the way through, and the pocket is sewn overtop it. I feel like this sort of sewn-together look is something you only see in these lesser-known (in America at least) Asian brands, but I love it. The fit warrants discussion. I think that Amazon\/Doublju is making it more obvious these days that the Asian sizes are labeled a size larger than the respective American sizes, which is good. This holds true across the three Doublju shirts I ordered, but it's worth noting two additional things - the shirts might end up being a little bit shorter than one would expect, so those who are long in the torso may have complications. Also, while the chest basically fits as you would expect for the (compensated) size, the sleeves are kind of tight. So if you're rockin' giant arms, might also have some issues. Even for my average, not muscular sort of self, the tightness on the arms feels just a bit disproportionate to the chest, but it's fairly trivial. All in all a great shirt, with a fanciful bit of pop to it."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I've heard great things about the Coolibar line, and with sun cancer in my family I take this seriously.  I am going on a cruise to Bermuda this summer and in addition to the sunscreen factor, I also want to look good yet modest.  I bought the capris and the cobalt blue long sleeved shirt.  This shirt and the capris match my qualifications!  I waffled a bit on the sizing, since some reviewers said they were tight.  I didn't find this to be true.  I'm a solid medium in clothes, 5'6\\\\\" and shrinking, and ok flabby.  The medium fit great.  Not swimsuit tight, not baggy, but a flattering looseness.  I do not look like the model, and have a fuller chest, and the medium looks great.  The capris are also fantastic.  Again, a medium in those as well.  I like those also because they are not a short Capri, but fall about mid shin.  No problems around the waist or thighs either! A great line!<br \/><br \/>So after my trip I am even more impressed with these than before.  I wondered if the tights would feel like a wetsuit or tee shirt in the water and how I would like the sensation of the extra fabric on my legs.  I found them light, easy to wear, and barely noticeable in or out of the water. They dry quickly, and I find them so comfortable that I would just wear them like summer leggings.  They wash and wear great and I am happier than ever with this purchase."}

My one issue with this one is the band at the back where the hooks are, there's this rough part at the edge that chafes. Of the 3 I have, one didn't have this issue, but one did. Though the rough part of that one slowly softened up after numerous hand washings. Hoping it happens with this pink one. Other than that, it's still uber comfy, great to just wear at home. As this doesn't really have that great a support, I wear other bras for that."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love these shirts.  The fit is perfect."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Already have a t-shirt like this, but without the people on it, so this is a better designed t-shirt. Bought it for my nephew (16 years old) and will be buying another one for myself."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It doesn't seem as though there is much consistency with this company.  Vitals: I am 6'7&#34; and 250 lbs.  An athletic build.  36&#34; to 42&#34; waist depending on the manufacturer.  I originally ordered XL as users said they run Large.  They do, and they don't.  I'll explain:  I gave the XL to my 5'11&#34; father and they fit him perfectly.  He has an evenly balanced waist vs. leg ratio, and they were a perfect fit length and waste-wise.  I ordered XXXL (3XL) in Black for myself going with the rule that more waist material will mean greater length for a guy not carrying a great deal around the middle.  (I'm no Nero Wolfe) They are to my taste length-wise.  I.e.: To my very heels, and the crotch makes it half-way to my knees.  I don't mind.  I wear them 'round the house with respect to those outside. They are so comfortable as to be nearly without sensation.  They feel cool and slithery at first.  Without the slight friction that comes with fine silk, nor the heat retention.  Without undergarments, and on a very warm night, these are comfortable in bed.  Couldn't be more pleased.  You might only notice you are wearing them when you glance down at their billowing furls and decide to sing &#34;Prince Ali, Ali is he, Ali A-Bab-Waaaa!&#34; with hopes that you'll soon happen upon funky blue Robin Williams in a lamp.  I digress.  I decided to order two more pairs of the XXXL (3XL) in gray.  Once again:  Shipping was perfect.  And these things would fit an elephant.  Unbelievably long!  Beyond the tips of my size 14\/ 15 feet standing.  I still love 'em though, so to keep from dragging them, I don my slippers.  It curbs the irritation of a 'train' dragging out behind or tripping me up should I halt forward momentum suddenly. --5 minute amendment:  These must go back for exchange: I could inadvertently awaken to multiple tenants in these things if I'm not very observant. Further amendment:  Both gray XXXL (3XL) pairs have XXXL printed on the inside.  One is exactly as right as my order for the black ones, whilst the other is about a foot longer.  (I'm not exaggerating) Returned.  No issues with Amazon, as usual.  You people are a paragon of business. Overturn Wall Street, will ya?  A word to the wise, and everyone else too;  As others have said:  Given the type of material, these are REVEALING.  If you wear these over your birth suit, it will form fit to your anatomy.  Every nuance will be outlined.  Picture silk in a heavy wind around the form of David Bowie parading around with a trouser monkey in the Labyrinth, or Sacha Baron Cohen's mute python pant companion in Sweeny.  Sorry gents, it's unavoidable without some boxers, a robe or a below waist sweater\/ t-shirt.  You probably don't want to wear this around the in-laws on a weekend get together.  Unless you're all very comfortable with anatomy. Sorry to be blunt, tis the way it is.  These are transparent in direct light, as well.  Black and gray alike.  You're safe if you're wearing boxers, briefs, or even Stacy Adams line of very light undergarments.  The two combined eliminate the transparency.  Just an FYI.  I digress.  Overall:  Shipping: Excellent   Comfort: Excellent   Length: Unreliable, requires compromise or patience to return and try again   Waist: Even the XL can be cinched to a mid 30's waist, or go as high as a 46&#34; waste, though may compromise length.   Modesty:  If you become forgetful, they will betray your birthright.  You've been advised.  I love 'em.  I have 4 pairs.  As for dependability or durability:  The jury is out, it has only been a week.  They look well made for as light as they are.  Good speed.  February 8th, 2016 UPDATE: Still durable,  still comfotable,  no unraveling or holes,  and has had no issues with the dryer.  Still inspires a person to sing Aladdin soundtrack while wearing and standing on the persian knockoff rug in my kitchen."}

The item was supposed to have shipped with in six days. It took them 12 just to inform me I wasn't going to get it. This isn't the fault of amazon but of Altrec who was to have shipped it. It looks like a nice hat but I sure won't be finding out and since my first experience with the company is so dismal I won't be having a second experience with them. At a time when companies know people are purchasing for the deadline of December 25th, surely they can do better than taking 12 days to say, \\\\\" Eh, we don't have it.\\\\\""}

Also, the top area could use some better stitching and could be tighter.<br \/>The swimsuit is good if you want to be modest but still look cute. I was hoping the white sides would slim my silhouette, however they did make my hips look big :( This is DEFINITELY full coverage. Not much skin showing at all in comparison to other swimsuits!<br \/>Quality overall: good material, okay stitching, fits kind of odd in some places but I made it work.<br \/>I'm rating in between a 3 and a 4... 3 because its too tight on my thighs and too loose in the chest area. 4 because it's cute and somewhat slimming.<br \/>Gonna keep it in my closet for when I need to be quite modest.

I like the longer length of the dress (which is more authentic for the period).  It was very flattering and I got loads of compliments.  My only warnings would be that you should order a size up than you normally would, as the fabric is a bit clingy.  Also, because of the low back, you can't wear a bra with the dress.  I didn't really have an issue with this, because I'm rather thin and flat-chested.  I'm also short.  If you're taller than 5'3\\\\\" the dress might not cover your butt that well.  If your size is any bigger that the lady in the picture it might not be so flattering on you.  If you're skinny it'll look fabulous.  Very Art deco and modish (like any flapper worth her salt should be).  ;)"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"A well made shirt, although I have to criticize it somewhat for not having certain features.  No gussets or interlining that I can see.  This *is* a casual shirt, granted.  Contrasting shirt threading is nice, though, and the gingham pattern works well with jeans and a navy blazer to give you some contrast.  Under a half-zip or v neck sweater is also good.  Or just untucked with rolled sleeves and navy\/tan shorts.  It's a very versatile pattern which is why I like it.<br \/><br \/>The sizing runs a little small for my taste for a casual shirt, so I suggest buying one size up.  It's not aggressively cut or fitted or anything like that - it's just a bit small.<br \/><br \/>It's a good shirt, I like it."}

They all shrank like crazy to the point they were not even regular length.  These shirts are great.  They have a trim fit and have not shrunk after 4 washings and the color is still bright.  The only possible down side is that they do not have the buttery soft feel of the expensive shirts.  Don't get me wrong, they are not coarse or rough.  They have a good cotton feel.  I do not feel as if I am giving up anything with these shirts and I'm getting the extra length that I need."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The fit of these pants is flattering. I took a chance purchasing them, figuring the cut would favor young men only. I am past 55 years old, and my wife says I look good in them (and I agree). I ordered the same size I would get off the shelf at a Wal Mart, and the waist\/inseam fit is comparable.<br \/>The fabric is heavier than denim yet a bit lighter than some canvas. The fabric-reinforced front legs are not so uncomfortable as to impede movement, but are like a pair of built-in riding chaps if you are looking for motorcycling pants. These should be durable enough for any type of construction activity, but I would expect them to be too hot for a roofer in the summertime!<br \/>**NOTE** If you are a big-bellied man, be aware that the cut of these pants are full waist. They could prove to be uncomfortable to your stomach."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"It's a little big on me but it's comfortable, I am 5 foot and weigh about 125 with a D cup. Going smaller with boobs as big as mine would have been a pain because the shirt is hard to get over my head already. But it is a pretty shirt, you just have to iron the v in the front because some of it buldges after the 1st wash."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I liked everything about these, nothing comes to mind that I did. They fit the way I wanted them to. (I got them a size larger than what I am so they were really comfy.)<br \/><br \/>These are mostly my 'be lazy and not move' pants, so I don't know how good they are for workouts, but they sure do tie together a lazy day."}

Adidas did a great job on these shoes."}

All five items I purchased from them, quit honestly the Goodwill would not even accept them, in my opinion. So happy I did not buy any of there dress shirts.    Please...check all there reviews, all the 1-stars are buried way in the back...I checked now...wish I had befor ordering.    Personally, I believe that they,there friends,relatives etc...write those 5-star ratings...if you notice there all quit similar in wording...three to four positive words.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"RUNS SMALL,ORDER A SIZE LARGER THAN NORMAL. I'm glad I read the reviews before I ordered. Because so many said it runs small,I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly.

I am considering going to second hand stores for better quality, and I find that to be a very sad thing...."}

I wear them fishing, running, biking, jogging, etc...I went out and bought another pair a week later. I have some under armour shorts in the same size and style and these are a little bit thicker but also a little more reinforced in the waist line, as well as loose. The UA shorts fit just fine, you can just tell the elastic is stretched a bit thinner. I got fish blood on these a couple weeks ago and was afraid they were ruined, everything washed out and they turned out fine. Probably my favorite shorts."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I have ordered from this company 2 times and both times they have sent the wrong item. I recieved the right outfit, just the wrong color.

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"I bought this outfit in 6-9 months for my four month old daughter. She is on the bigger size, so I figured within no time she will fit into the clothes. However, it seems the brand runs large and the coat itself looks like it could be 18 months."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Nice colors (plum and red).  Seems well made.  It fits all my essential cards and my license slides out easily enough when I must remove it (like at the airport).  Only complaint:  Once all slots are full of cards, it kinda flops open easily like it \u201cwants\u201d to stay open...  I wish there was a snap to keep it closed.  But it\u2019s not a huge deal since I\u2019ll carry it in a small purse.  So I\u2019m keeping it."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Too wide. Better if it was slim fit for normal sized people."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I like the vibrant as well as attractive pattern of this cardigan alot.  It is also versatile so it would coordinate well with pants, skirt or even a sleeveless dress.  It can be worn to work as well.  It is not bulky but on the thin side, but I like it.  I received it quite rapidly and packaging was top notch.  I would order from this seller again."}

I couldn't even wear these because the waist is so tall that they will not stay up.<br \/>They seem like they are made for giants with the extra high waist & super long length.<br \/><br \/>I bought some Dickies Gen Flex Cargo"}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"This is not a wallet. I have no idea what it is supposed to hold but if your homeless and need a place for your coins and occasional bills, this is for you."}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"The color in the photo (Hot Pink) is not what you get, so if you are looking for Red, this will meet your needs.  The waist fit was fine but note the length will not cover your &#34;bottom&#34;, unless you wear it very, very low on your hips.  This was used for a Halloween costume so wish it had been just a little longer."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"So cute. The material is light, not that fleece or microfleece stuff, so it's not going to keep the baby warm at night without a blanket, if that's what you're looking for. But if you love the ease and utility of sleepers, these are great for the daytime, for baby to be active in without getting too hot. I got size 3-6 months and my 5 month old's weight is 70th?% and height is 90th and they fit snug but fine."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love it, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I like this t-shirt and the bowling team I'm on may get it as well.  However, I rated it at 4 instead of 5 stars because, for an XL, it was a bit snug.  Oh well."}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"Mask arrived early.  Really can't explain how geeked I was when I opened it. Real metal. Has a nice weight to it.  Leather straps allow for a good fit.  Inside is suede material but I may add some foam cushions around the nose if i decide to wear for it a long time.  Great for any fan of the MetalFace Villain.<br \/><br \/>Whichever intern over at Armory Replicas suggested making these is a genius!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"The palms are really nice suede...not cheap and flimsy.  The interior is soft and warm with its lining.   The mitten top part that goes over your fingers has a velcro attachment to stick onto the top part of your hand...the velcro looks cheap and probably with come unsewn after a few wearings.  The wool is nice."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"My husband loves them.. Just the right weight and texture.  Washed them prior to use!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Finally.....I must have drove Amazon nuts while trying to find the ME jacket. It arrived as expected, well protected packaging, but most of all, IT FIT.

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"If you read the measurements they provide you'll be fine with sizing. I did modify the top to bring the cups closer together. The bottoms also aren't like 'shaper' material'-- it's swimsuit material. Not super sturdy to make you slim--just FYI. It's a great suit though. I felt comfortable (and the chesticles looked amazing). It was sexy enough to be appealing, but it was still modest enough to be able to wear in front of my brother. It was a great buy"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Really weird feeling.  What do you expect though?!  I felt like if I wore a dress then it may fall onto the floor if I bust a move."}

I am five foot nine and roughly a size fourteen, I bought the X-large. The shirt does fit as pictured. I do think I should have ordered a size down because it does look like a dress but with some tights and heels, it really is a cute dress."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"They sent me the wrong hat twice\/ The first time I ordered this, I received a Leonardo one instead. I got in touch with customer support and I was guaranteed the hat I ordered if I placed another order. So I did and when it arrived I opened the packaged to see it was a Donatello hat. Two times I ordered this supposed Michelangelo hat but received two different turtles. This was the worst experience I've had on amazon so far. It's a nice quality hat but I just wanted the one I ordered."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This dress is well worth the price we paid for it.  It shipped very quickly, and was even nicer looking than the picture depicted.  My daughter loves it, and she will be wearing it for her First Communion soon.  I thought it might look a little too much like a flower-girl dress, but it doesn't.  It is surprisingly lightweight for as much material as it looks like it has to it.  It runs a little bit larger than what I feel are standard sizes - she is 8 and generally wears a children's size 8 in dresses, but when she tried it on it is a little larger in the chest and arm area than I had expected.<br \/><br \/>Pros: Beautiful dress, lightweight<br \/><br \/>Cons: Slightly larger than standard sizing"}

When they arrived I was so upset to find that the sizing is all messed up and they are at least 2 sizes smaller than the actual size.<br \/>Such a bummer, the craftmanship is fantastic, just issues with the sizing."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I do find they are a little too &#34;high rise&#34; in the back and on me, they tend to bunch up just below the belt in back.  Other than that they have the extra room needed in the upper thigh area.  I am 5'7&#34; and 144 and am a &#34;pear&#34; shape.  It helps they have a little stretch so that they contract after sitting or driving & don't look bagged out after wearing for a few hours."}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"These gloves give the appearance of being warm and dry but one time out to clear the snow and ice off my car and I had to take them off before my fingertips froze. I think the dispersement of material is uneven in the tips of the gloves because a few fingers were fine - and I know my finger tips don't have related issues! I really thought these gloves would be ideal from what I read about them but I am disappointed."}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"We gave this as a gift and the fit was great!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"These style panties are my favorite.  They fit perfectly and hug your hips.  They don't give you panty lines and they are very comfy!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love these pants. I work from home for the majority of my time, but every now and then I have to attend business casual meetings. Paired with a button-down shirt and dress shoes, these pants are great to wear in a business casual setting. I love that I can still wear a t-shirt or blouse to dress them down with boots or sneakers as well.<br \/><br \/>I have been hanging them to dry to avoid shrinking them in the dryer, but they do require ironing if you choose that route."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"It can be hard to find tank tops that are long enough and stretchy enough to be my nursing under-layer (and for some reason the good ones always seem to get discontinued). This is a great solution to the problem of belly-show while NIP. The tanks are nice and long, and don't ride up. I had to order a size larger than recommended based on my bra size."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Cute and fits okay but its not the same one in the pic the top has no wire support so if your boobs don't sit up natural you may not want this, my boyfriend loved it but I didn't!"}

{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I love this coat, because it's very nice looking coat with it's fitted design, the color is beautiful (btw it is not navy, it is a beautiful teal), and is quality made.  The 2 reasons I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5 are:<br \/><br \/>1) The upper arm is too snug.  The designers need to revamp their XL pattern as the body fits my size 18 build fine, but they have to remember if you have a size 18 body you will also have size 18 upper arms and they obviously did not make this adjustment as it snugly &#34;just&#34; fits my upper arms with a a lightweight shirt on.  I cannot wear the coat with anything heavier such as a sweatshirt or sweater.<br \/><br \/>2) Which brings me to my 2nd reason for rating it at 4 stars.  I live in northern IN and work at a large private university in which my walk from the parking lot to my office is a little over 1\/3 mile and it gets VERY cold walking in the winter.  I bought the coat because I wanted something longer to keep my thighs warm and also something with down so that I didn't have to wear layers to keep warm walking into work.  The length is great and does keep my thighs warm, but I've found that the coat does not keep me warm if the temp is under 20 degrees or if it's under 30 degrees with any type of wind (which is is the majority of the time in the winter in northern IN).  This is disappointing because I cannot add layers under it due to the sleeve size and so I have not been able to wear my coat since mid December, which defeats the purpose of why I bought it.<br \/><br \/>With all that said, I still love the coat and I am working on going down in size, so I figure when I drop to a size 16 or less I should be able to layer under the coat and this will solve both problems, but I just wanted to let those out there looking at know the sizing and warmth issues."}
{"star_rating":1,"review_body":"Not what I was expecting. I pulled it out of the box and found a live moth, and it fits my 2 year old niece better than it fits me.  I needed it for work, and it was just a waste of money."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I got the size D and used them for my backless wedding dress. They felt awesome. Honestly, I couldn't have picked a better bra for my wedding day. You can see the outline of your areola in them but I don't think it'd show through clothing. Definitely getting more!!!"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"This Fruit of the Loom hooded jacket with full zipper is make well out of good quality material. It is heavy and warm. It arrived on time and in good condition. My only complaint was it was not in a plastic bag and was wrinkled."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Very good option."}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"Shirt fits great.  But unless you have time to iron at least the sleeves, collar and pocket the shirt is too wrinkled even right of the dryer."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love it! It's my first week wearing it and it's everything I could want and more. It really gives you a curvy-small waist shape. I have yet to see if it really reduced your waistline but I'm guessing that takes some time. So far I'm very happy about my squeem and the shape it gives you. Do not wear with light or thin clothing because it will show. Looks great when wearing workout gear though."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"This night gown is exactly what I wanted.  The night gown arrived quickly and well packaged.  If you are looking for an all cotton white sleeveless night gown I highly recommend this one."}

{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Absolutely love.. have bought 4 different colors, perfect for the summer because they are thin.. I am 5&#34;4 125lbs and I bought size Large and fits perfect.. looks adorable with high waisted shorts, crop top, and wedge, definitely thinking about getting more color!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Large but I use it for the pool & shower & it is PERFECT.!"}

{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"Damn Near Kilt 'Em Men's Sport Utility Kilt X-Large Brown;  I wear a size 42 in jeans comfortably.  the size chart tells me I should be able to fit a L, but just in case I also bought an XL.  The Kilts look and feel  wonderful.  The bummer came in that the labeled XL and the L I got where exactly the same size, and did not fit.  I am hoping I mistakenly got two L and can replace them with XL.<br \/><br \/>I have submitted refund as the option for a size up replacement are not available.  I will also have to have  some of my refund deducted to pay for the return.<br \/><br \/>I will update this accordingly as this transaction and return work themselves out :-(<br \/><br \/>Update:  11\/7\/2013<br \/><br \/>Great Kilts, and they quickly refunded my money.  Just keep in mind that you must measure using tape and not your Jean size as they can very.  At this time not sure If i got 2 L, or XL.  They where courteous and concerned with my lack of satisfaction with the order.  My only grief up to this point is I will have to look to a larger Kilt or possibly less quality.  \/sigh"}
{"star_rating":2,"review_body":"The one with the buttons is better than the other as it's MUCH easier to get over your baby's head - however, as you quickly discover as a new parent: who wants buttons on baby clothes?!?!  So irritating and time consuming on a small baby you are changing so often.  And these fit SO small.  My newborn - weighing in at 7 lb, 7 oz - had a hard time fitting into them - especially the one with no buttons.  They are so little and fragile, you don't want to have to squeeze them into something.  It was very uncomfortable for my baby.  Additionally, the elastic at the bottom is too tight.  When you pull it up for a diaper change, it digs in uncomfortably to the baby's belly.  It was doing that as early as 3 weeks old and my baby is average for weight.  I don't recommend."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Elf on the shelf is a big deal around my house. And my daughter is quite tall and slender, so was excited to find these in her size as her present to open from our Elf as he left Christmas Eve. They were long enough and they did not shrink horribly like most do after you wash and dry!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great material"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"I bought this for my teenage son who is 6 ft tall. The costume was fine in height, but the head was too loose and there was a 1 inch gap between the bottom of the head and the shoulders. I stitched two darts into the back of the head and sewed a 6 inch wide piece of black material to the bottom of the head, so it can tuck under the shoulders. Also the back of the costume has a big long slit with only one tie at the top (think hospital gown!!), so I added more ties.  Now it's a great costume!"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Love it"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"Great shirt 49 niner fan since birth!"}
{"star_rating":3,"review_body":"It's a bit thicker than I'd like it to be, certainly much too thick to carry around in my pocket.  But since I'm not doing that, and it only holds cards that I don't use very often, then it is functional."}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"I love it. So comfortable"}
{"star_rating":4,"review_body":"good product"}
{"star_rating":5,"review_body":"The garment is moderately inexpensive, well made, warm and very feminine! It is also stylish and not a&#34; flash in the pan fad style&#34;! I will continue to support this product!"}
