    "After you train a model, you can use [Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-batch.html) to perform inferences with the model. In Batch Transform you provide your inference data as a S3 uri and SageMaker will care of downloading it, running the prediction and uploading the results afterwards to S3 again. You can find more documentation for Batch Transform [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html)\n",
